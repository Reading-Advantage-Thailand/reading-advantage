However, critics contend that the long-term effects of GMOs on human health and biodiversity are still not fully understood. This issue requires careful consideration of both the scientific data and the ethical implications of altering the genetic makeup of our food supply. Only through informed, balanced discourse can we ensure that our approach to genetic modification in agriculture is both responsible and sustainable.\"
