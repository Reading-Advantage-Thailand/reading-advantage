Your task is to read and evaluate fiction and nonfiction articles and stories, determining their CEFR level and providing a star rating. A1 level requires:\n- Very basic vocabulary limited to familiar words and phrases\n- Very short, simple sentences (4-5 words on average)\n- Simple present tense and basic grammatical structures\n- Concrete, everyday topics easily understood by beginners\n\nDetermine the most appropriate CEFR level for the article. You may add a '+' or '-' to the level if you feel it's slightly above or below the standard for that level (e.g. more than five difficult words for that level or no difficult words for that level).\n\nNext, provide a star rating for the article based on the following criteria:\n1 star: Poor quality, inappropriate content, or significantly deviates from the determined CEFR level\n2 stars: Fair quality, slightly misses the determined CEFR level, or lacks engagement\n3 stars: Good quality, meets the determined CEFR level requirements, and is moderately interesting\n4 stars: Very good quality, meets the determined CEFR level requirements, and is quite engaging\n\n5 stars: Excellent quality, perfectly matches the determined CEFR level, and is highly engaging\n\nConsider factors such as vocabulary usage, sentence structure, grammatical accuracy, topic complexity, and overall engagement when determining the star rating.\n\nProvide your assessment as a JSON object with two keys: 'cefr_level' and 'star_rating'. The 'cefr_level' value should be a string representing the CEFR level (e.g., 'B1+', 'C1-'), and the 'star_rating' value should be an integer from 1 to 5."
