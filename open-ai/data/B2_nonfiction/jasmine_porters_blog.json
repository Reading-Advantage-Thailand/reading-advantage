  "passage": "Today has been a difficult day filled with arguments.\nI left university after completing my graphic design course in the\nsummer. Until then I had lived in various subsidised university\naccommodation over four years. So leaving a sheltered life and\nhaving to find accommodation in the market place was a real\nshock. We decided, two girls and two boys, to find a flat, and I\nvolunteered to speak to the flat-owners.\nAt first sight one would think that our university town would be\nan easy place to find accommodation. All the heavy industry and\nmanufacturing industries closed down a couple of decades ago\nand many people moved away to find work, so compared with the\ncountry as a whole house prices are low here. Flats of various\nsizes are available, but finding a cheap flat of a reasonable size\naffordable for four young people was challenging.\nLike any sizeable town, ours has districts with different housing. Goldmark in the west contains\nmost of the wealthy housing and we didn’t bother looking there. Newtown way out to the south\nis mostly prefabricated housing blocks with high levels of unemployment but very little going on\nat the cultural level. After eliminating those areas, we confined our search to Babylon in the east\nwith its multicultural background.\nOf the four of us three were living on savings and welfare payments. Paul, one of the boys,\nhad a night job working in a twenty-four hour mini-supermarket in the town centre. Our poor\neconomic profile meant that flat owners were reluctant to rent to us, fearing that we would\ndefault on our rent payments. In the end we claimed to have jobs that we did not. If we hadn’t\ndone so, we wouldn’t have found anywhere.\nBy far the most disturbing aspect during our search was the run-down character of so much of\nthe property on offer. Much of it fell far below legal standards: the gas and electricity systems\nwere poorly maintained and the sewage systems were below standard. Usually these properties\nwere meagerly furnished and were extremely dirty. We had to choose the least worst option\nwhich was a three-roomed flat on the fourth floor of a tenement building.\nWe moved in today. The landlord asked for a thousand Euro deposit and three months rent in\nadvance. With great difficulty we complied. The place is filthy and I have drawn up a list of work\nthat needs to be done to make the place liveable. As we only have three rooms we drew lots\nto see who would end up with the kitchen: the other girl, Dora, chose the short straw. Well, she\ncan make cups of tea during the night.\nAnyway I must sign off now as I have work to do.\nJ"
