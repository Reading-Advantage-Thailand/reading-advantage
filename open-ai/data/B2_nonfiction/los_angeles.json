Although the town offers many attractions centered around Hollywood culture, there is a lot to see and visit in Los Angeles.\nOf course, all things related to Hollywood are popular tourist attractions. The Hollywood Sign, located the Hollywood Hills of the Santa Monica Mountains, is a famous landmark for this star-studded town.

This landmark contains more than 2500 brass stars dedicated to celebrities who have made a significant impact on the entertainment industry.
