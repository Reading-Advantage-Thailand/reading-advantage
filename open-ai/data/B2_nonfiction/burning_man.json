  "passage": "1. On the 21st June 1986 – the date of the summer solstice – Larry Harvey and Jerry\nJames invited a few friends to Baker Beach in San Francisco to celebrate the longest\nday of the year. They marked the event by setting fire to a nine foot wooden model\nof a man and a dog. As they watched the flames consume the crudely made figures,\nnone of them could have known how their small gathering would grow over the next\ntwo decades and develop into an annual seven day experience that has become\nknown simply as Burning Man. In 2011, so many people wanted to be part of it that\nthe number of participants had to be limited to 50,000.\n2. Even the organisers of the Burning Man project find it difficult to describe the\nexperience. ‘Trying to explain what Burning Man is to someone who has never been\nto the event,’ says their official website, ‘is a bit like trying to explain what a particular\ncolour looks like to someone who is blind.’ Part celebration, part act of rebellion,\npart community theatre, the week long event – now held in the Black Rock Desert\nof Nevada – attracts tens of thousands of people. They still come to watch the ritual\ndestruction of a wooden figure (now more than forty feet high), but most of all they\ncome to take part in a series of spontaneous ‘happenings’ and to create a temporary\ncommunity of like-minded people.\n3. Larry Harvey, one of the founding members, is now executive director and has\nbecome the project’s official spokesperson. Famous for his grey cowboy hat, which\nhe wears in memory of his father, he has become a familiar figure in the media,\nfeaturing on television news reports and in newspaper and magazine articles that\nappear as regularly as the Burning Man festival itself. The success and the scale of\nthe Burning Man owe a great deal to Larry Harvey’s imagination and sense of vision.\n4. Burning Man is often called a phenomenon of the ‘Internet Generation’ and,\nlike social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, the festival encourages\nthe notions of community participation and self-expression. The event is governed\nby ten principles which emphasise the key beliefs of self-reliance and communal\nresponsibility. People are encouraged to take part in the events and - by working with\nand helping each other - to discover something about themselves.\n5. Although the event takes place in a harsh desert environment, all participants –\ncalled ‘burners’ – are expected to be able to fend for themselves over the seven day\nperiod. The organisers do not provide meals or accommodation and there are no\nconventional shops to buy food at or hotels to sleep in. In fact, Burning Man has its\nown distinct economy based on the concept of gift-giving, and the use of money is\nforbidden.\n6. Burners are encouraged to express themselves artistically through painting,\nmusic, dance, performance and other forms of creativity. Each year Larry Harvey\nannounces a theme for the event to provide them with inspiration – in the year 2006,\nfor example, it was ‘Hope and Fear’. The theme influences almost everything about\nthe event – from the clothes the people wear to the vehicles they travel around in.\nIn keeping with the original idea many of the art exhibits and events revolve around\nfire, and specially constructed platforms are erected to ensure that all acts of burning\nare done safely.\n7. For the duration of the event the burners make their home in a self-built community\ncalled Black Rock City, which regular attendees abbreviate to the letters BRC. The\ncity is always arranged in a distinctive semi-circular pattern, but its street names differ\nfrom year to year in keeping with the changing theme. Just as it seems to appear\nmiraculously in the desert, the city disappears with equal suddenness. Following the\nprinciple of ‘Leave No Trace’, the participants dismantle the temporary structures\nthat they built for shelter and take them away together with all their litter as they\ndepart, leaving the desert in the same condition that they found it. Once Burning Man\nis over for the year, it is as if it never took place at all."
