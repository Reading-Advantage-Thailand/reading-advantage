Al-Rutba is about 435 kilometers -LRB- 270 miles -RRB- west of the country's capital, Baghdad.\nAlso Tuesday, a car bomb exploded near a busy market in the central Iraqi town of Musayyib in Babil province, killing one person and injured 11, police in Baghdad said.\nMusayyib, a largely Shiite town, is about 70 kilometers -LRB- 43 miles -RRB- south of Baghdad.\nIraq has seen a sharp increase in tension between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government.\nSunnis, who represent a minority of Iraqis, have felt politically marginalized since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Shiites make up a majority of Iraqis.\nSo far in 2013, more than 6,000 people have been killed in Iraq. More than 350 of those deaths came this month, and almost 1,000 happened in September.\nJournalist Mohammed Adnan in Falluja contributed to this report.\n"
