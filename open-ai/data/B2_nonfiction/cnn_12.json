  "summary": "A report on the current state of global greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting both concerning record-high levels and some positive trends in emission reductions, with a call for urgent action to prevent catastrophic climate change.",
  "image_description": "An image of smoke stacks and exhaust pipes emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, juxtaposed with a graph showing a slight decrease in emissions in recent years.",
  "passage": "Smoke stacks and exhaust pipes around the world are blasting greenhouse gas emissions to a new record annual high. They should break 39 billion tons this year.\nBut there's also some good news, a new study published Tuesday said. The rate at which people are polluting the air may be leveling off.\nIn the West, emissions contributing to global warming even dropped last year.\nThe United States pumped 3.7 % less carbon dioxide into the air in 2012 than in the previous year; Europe 1.8 % less.\nGlobally, greenhouse gases are being emitted at a slower rate this year than they were last year, and in both years the climb in emissions was less intense than in the past decade taken as a whole, said researchers at Britain's East Anglia University.\nJustices to review greenhouse gas regulation\nDrop in the bucket\nIt's an improvement -- but a drop in the bucket by global emission standards.\nGreenhouse gases are blowing into the atmosphere at rates 61 % higher than they were in 1990, the baseline year for the Kyoto Protocol.\nThe international agreement is designed to decrease emissions contributing to global warming by holding its signees to reduction goals. The vast majority of the world's nations have signed on to it.\nThe United States is not one of them.\nChina is.\nBut the world's largest carbon emitter, which wrested the dubious title from the United States in recent years, pumped 5.9 % more into the atmosphere in 2012 than in the previous year.\nIndia contributed 7.7 % more emissions in 2012.\nPath to catastrophe\nNot only must the increase stop, the researchers said, but industrialized nations must achieve a global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\nTime is running out to stop the world from reaching a dreading global warming threshold.\nThe world is on a course with current emission levels to reach a rise in global temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius or more and end up in the worst climate change scenario issued by the U.N. panel on climate change.\nThe study includes a carbon atlas, which shows levels of pollution emitted by each nation and their development over the last 50 years.\nIn 2012, the largest contributors of greenhouse gases were China with 27 %, the United States with 14 % and the European Union with 10 %.\nOn an individual basis, China and the EU were at the same level, with 7.7 tons of carbon gas emitted per person and year.\nAmericans still polluted the most by far, with more than 17 tons of carbon gas emitted per person in 2012.\nThe nuclear renaissance:What went wrong ?\n"
