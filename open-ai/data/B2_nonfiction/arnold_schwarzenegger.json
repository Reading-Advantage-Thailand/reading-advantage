  "passage": "Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the most recognizable celebrities in the United States of America. The Austrian-born star came to the U.S. in the late 1960s when he was an international star in the body-building circuit. Since then, Schwarzenegger has had multiple careers as an actor, politician, and philanthropist.\n \nSchwarzenegger began weight training at the age of 15. By the time he was 20 years old, he had won the prestigious Mr. Universe title. The professional body-building honor is awarded annually, but this was not his only body-building title on his resume. He won seven Mr. Olympia titles during his body-building career. Additionally, he wrote several books on the subject. His body-building career spanned from 1965 to 1980.\nHis film career began in 1970 when he starred in a little-known movie called Hercules in New York. However, from these beginnings, Schwarzenegger cultivated a long, and successful career as an action movie star in Hollywood. His movies are some of the most popular films to ever show in the U.S. His most recognizable role was arguably as the Terminator in the film series of the same name. Following a long and successful film career, Schwarzenegger, who was always interested in politics, began a political career that culminated with his election to two terms as California's Governor.\nSchwarzenegger was first elected governor in October, 2003, running on a Republican Party platform. He enjoyed moderate success as governor in his first years, but struggled greatly after that. He had many political opponents who cited that he had no political experience, and had won the elections simply because of his popularity. Schwarzenegger's term in office was rocked by sexual misconduct allegations that tainted his political career. He remains a very popular cultural figure in the United States."
