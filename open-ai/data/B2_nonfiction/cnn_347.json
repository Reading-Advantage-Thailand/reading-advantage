In Japan, the islands are known as the Senkaku.\nThe rally was organized by Toshio Tamogami, a former Japanese chief of staff for the Self Defense Force.\nJapan rejects China's demand for an apology\n Senkaku Islands is Japan's traditional territory, Tamogami said. If we do n't protect it, China will make action to take it. \nTamogami called China a thief and vowed to protect the islands.\nBeijing and Tokyo have been clashing over the arrest of a Chinese fishing captain by Japan off the disputed islands.\nThe captain was accused of hitting two Japanese coast guard ships and obstructing public officers while they performed their duties.\n I am very angry with China, said student Shohei Fukumoto.\nChina should apologize and pay for the repair of the vessel because the captain was in Japan's territory when the accident happened, according to Fukumoto.\nJapan has since freed the fishing captain, who returned to a hero's welcome in China.\nYoko Sakamoto, 55, said Japan has been too easy on China.\n I 'd like to criticize Japanese government's weak attitude toward China and Senkaku Islands issue, rather than China itself, Sakamoto said. We should get our national pride back. \nThe captain's arrest prompted the suspension of diplomatic talks and canceled trips between the nations.\nBeijing has sought an apology and compensation over the arrest, which Tokyo has rejected.\nJapan has also demanded compensation for damage done to coast guard ships.\nJournalist Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report.\n"
