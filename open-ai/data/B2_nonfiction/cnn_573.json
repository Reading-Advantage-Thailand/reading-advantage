The seven-day cruise is being cut short by one day.\nSick passengers are being asked to stay in their cabins, while staff disinfect public areas such as restrooms and elevators.\nThe decision to cut the trip short was made based on forecasts for heavy fog, not the outbreak, Benson said.\nCNN first learned of the stricken Princess ship from a Twitter post by the Houston Chronicle.\nRoyal Caribbean cruise ship returns home - with a sickness record\nCNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report.\n"
