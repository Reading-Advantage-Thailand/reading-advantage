I know this is difficult for you. I recommend more practice at home. Listen to English TV shows, podcasts and radio as much as possible.

At 62 and roughly 380 pounds, Mark Rucker once resembled the big, friendly character.\nNow, they call him The Beast. \nThe nickname is apt. Since February 2011, Rucker has run his first 5K, his first 10K, his first half-marathon and his first marathon. He's completed an Olympic-distance triathlon and lost more than 100 pounds. And on August 26, he 'll participate in his first full-length Ironman competition in Louisville, Kentucky.\nLike they say, he's a beast.\n What he does after this Ironman, I do n't know, his wife, Annita Rucker, said with a laugh. I hope he can find something to focus all this energy on. \nFrom Rucker's DailyMile blog: April 18, 2011 -- First day of the Couch to 5K program. That was not good. But at least I did the whole workout -LRB- 1.98 miles / 32 minutes / 16:10 pace -RRB-\nChange is a funny thing, Rucker says. Often, the desire to change grows over time. A series of events leads to an a ha moment, when desire must meet with the proper tools and the right inspiration.\nIn the summer of 2010, Rucker, of Lexington, Kentucky, and his family went to Dollywood in Tennessee. His daughter was 11 at the time, a little daredevil, and wanted to ride all the roller coasters. Unfortunately, Rucker could n't fit on any of them with her.\n She was devastated; I was crushed, Rucker said. But even that was n't enough to get me started on the journey. I guess I just did n't know how to do it. \nDoes parenting make us fat ?\nIn January 2011, he reconnected with an old elementary school friend, Anita Mills, and the two began talking on Facebook, discussing Mills240-pound weight loss.\nHer transformation was his inspiration. But he still was n't ready to change.\nAfter weighing in at about 365 pounds, he stopped stepping on the scale. He was diagnosed with sleep apnea and put on medication for high blood pressure. He feared that he was diabetic but would n't visit his doctor.\nThe day after the 2011 Super Bowl, Rucker woke up in pain. Once again, he had overindulged the night before, and his digestive system revolted. He was tired, sick and unhappy.\n Something clicked, he said. I realized that if I kept doing it, I would significantly shorten my life. \nRucker took Millsdieting hints to heart and cut out sugary drinks. He dropped his two-liter-a-day soda habit and picked up water. He stopped ordering McDonald's McGriddles for breakfast and eating peanut M&M s by the pound. He threw away his Cheez-Its.\n It's hard to say what my daily -LRB- calorie -RRB- intake was, he said, looking back. I did it to myself. I was really unhappy with the way my life was, and I think food was that comfort for me. \nJune 19, 2011 -- Last day of Couch 2 5K. I think I 'll call it The Father's Day Beastly 5K. I was the only competitor and I finished in 1st place. I ca n't even begin to explain how I feel right now. And no one or no thing can ever take this away from me. I AM a runner. I AM an achiever. I AM a Beast. On to Bridge 2 10K !!! \nRucker's job as a real estate attorney kept him sedentary. So he started to walk on his lunch break, using his iPhone to post his distance on DailyMile.com. The site shared his progress on Twitter and Facebook. Friends posted replies that the site's app read aloud to Rucker through his headphones during workouts.\nWiring the world to fight obesity\n That was a huge motivator to me, he said.

Less than a month later, he tackled a 10K, finishing dead last but finishing all the same. His blog that night complained about the cross-country course's hills but promised to begin training for a half-marathon the next day.\n The focus he has, the drive he has... it's so refreshing, Annita Rucker said. It's the old Mark I did n't even know -- probably the Mark from law school. \nThe Ruckers married in October 2000. For 11 years, Annita Rucker watched the man she married -- the dreamer, the achiever -- struggle to maintain his optimism while grappling with a shrinking housing market and a growing body.\nTheir son and daughter -- two children from Rucker's first marriage -- came to visit often, and Annita Rucker found herself entertaining the young kids while her husband remained stationary.\n I used to complain that he was living life on the sidelines, never participating, she said. Now, he's so active with them. Last year, my father had Parkinson's and was hospitalized for 10 weeks. Mark stepped up to the plate and did all the cooking, the laundry, everything. Before this, that never would have happened. \n My wife jokes, I 've got a brand new husband, Rucker said with a long laugh. I think she's a lot happier with me... because I 'm much happier. \nAugust 18, 2011 -- Three mile walk at work on my lunch break. Some days I got ta dig down deep to find the motivation. Some days it's really hard. Today is one of those days. \nRucker is now training for his first Ironman competition. A typical week includes 4:30 a.m. swims, 6-mile runs after work and hours of cycling on Saturday and Sunday. At 260 pounds, he's stopped focusing on losing weight and started focusing on building muscle.\nThere are good and bad days. Some blog posts sing of the serotonin rushing through his brain. Others show his discouragement of a bad swim or a slow run. He's a beast, but one who feels pain.\nIronman champ: The importance of R&R\nStill, it's amazing, even to him, that a guy who less than two years ago got winded walking up a flight of stairs can push himself this far, this fast.\n I 'm the guy in the overalls -LRB- who's -RRB- shoveling the coal in the train, he said. I do n't know exactly where it's going, but I 'm going to do everything I can to keep it moving. \nFebruary 18, 2012 -- Woot woot !!

This year, his family went back to Dollywood and rode all the rides together.\nRucker wants to become a motivational speaker, to be that inspiration for others that Mills was for him. Possible title for his speech: Be the Beast that you can be. \n When I was so overweight, I felt so dead to everything, Rucker said.

Living in Los Angeles has given me the chance to watch one of the oldest baseball teams in the history of the game -- the Dodgers. The team came into existence in New York City in the 1880s, when they were known by several names. Until 1956, the Dodgers played in Brooklyn New York, but in 1957, the team moved west to Los Angeles, and it has played there ever since.\n \nI recently asked my wife Josie if she wanted to go to a game one night, and of course she said yes. \"Why wouldn't I want to go? The weather is great and the stadium is beautiful. Besides, I think we need a break in our routine,\" she said. \"You're absolutely right, baby. Let's go!\" I said.\nWe were off to Dodger Stadium, which is nestled in the hills just north of downtown L.A. in a neighborhood called Chavez Ravine. Even though it is the third oldest stadium in the country, it is still beautiful. \"Wow. This place never gets old,\" I said as we got to our seats. Josie agreed. It was a perfect night for a ball game. The temperature was in the low 70s, and it was a clear, breezy night.\nThe Dodgers were playing the Giants that night. The two teams have been playing each other for about 100 years, ever since both teams were in New York. The Giants moved the same year the Dodgers did. only they moved up north to San Francisco. That didn't stop the rivalry though. The teams hate each other today as much as they did back in New York. The best part of the night was that the Dodgers won, so I had a couple of Dodger Dogs. \"I don't know what they do to these hot dogs, but they are delicious,\" I told Josie. She wiped some mustard off her face and said, \"Absolutely!\"\n","summary":"Experience the thrill of attending a Dodgers game at the historic Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles and witness the age-old rivalry between the Dodgers and the Giants.","image_description":"An illuminated Dodger Stadium under the night sky with fans cheering in the stands."}}]}

That is where there is a gift shop. Some people walk 1,860 steps to the top. Every year there is even a race, with people competing to see who can walk up to the top the fastest.\nThe landmark is not just famous because of its height. In 1945, a small plane crashed into it. More than 30 people have tried to kill themselves by jumping off the building. In 1933 it was featured in the movie King Kong, where a giant gorilla climbs to the top and falls to his death after being attacked by airplanes.

When he was a kid, his parents sent him to a Catholic school. He didn't know much about the school. Of course he didn't know much about anything when he was 6 years old, but he did know one thing -- all his friends from the neighborhood went to a public school. Dennis was the only boy that went to a private school, and his friends would often tease him about it. \"You're not one of us! You're not one of us,\" they would sometimes chant. He wasn't really alone, though. His friend Patricia also went to the Catholic school, but she was a girl. After a while, they began walking to the small school together every morning. Pat was the first girl friend Dennis had ever had. She wasn't his girlfriend. She was just a friend who happened to be a girl.\n \nThe nuns at the school were very mean. They ruled the school like it was a prison. Dennis was afraid to even raise his hand to ask a question. His mother was often called into meetings with the principal about Dennis, who would also sit in the office listening to the principal telling his mother how smart he was, but was very lazy. Needless to say, Dennis didn't do well in school and ended up going to a junior college after high school. He didn't do very well there either, and soon dropped out.\nThat all changed after Dennis grew up and started working. He had worked for many years before deciding he wanted to earn a degree after all. Dennis went back to school at the age of 30, and soon was a college graduate with a degree. It turned out Dennis wasn't as lazy as those nuns thought he was.","summary":"Follow Dennis's transformative journey from struggling student to college graduate, as he overcomes challenges and proves his true potential.","image_description":"An image of a man in a cap and gown, holding a diploma, with a background of a university campus."}}]}

Learning to drive is a rite of passage. It is one of the steps young people take to develop into adulthood. This is a wondrous time full of excitement and expectations. One of the most attractive things about learning to drive is the freedom that comes from operating a vehicle.\n \nOnce people are able to drive a vehicle, they can go anywhere in the city and beyond. In Southern California, the region was planned and built in a spread-out fashion with miles and miles of freeway access. A new driver no longer needs to rely on others to go somewhere. He or she is now free to go out on their own.\nWhen Michael Allen first learned to drive, he was so excited. He was 16 years old, which in California means he can get a driver's permit. After six months with a permit, he could have a license to drive. Michael had been pestering his father to teach him how to drive for months and now came the big day. His father Edward was a big strong man, who insisted on teaching Michael on a standard transmission car. That meant Michael had to learn how to operate a clutch and gear shifter, which is not easy.\nThe two began their lessons. Edward was a difficult task-master, and Michael was having great difficulty at first. \"Let the clutch out slowly,\" Edward began yelling every time Michael didn't do it correctly. \"Ease it through. You can do it,\" said Edward to his son. \"I'm trying, dad. I'm trying,\" said Michael. It was not pleasant at first, but soon Michael was driving up and down the block. He was very pleased, and so was his dad.

She had always enjoyed fishing when she was a child, but had never gone fishing in the ocean. Her dad liked to fish very often. Her big brother Jack was never the outdoor type, so her dad took her out often. One of his favorite spots was Lake Isabella, which was about two hours from their home. She recalls how she and her dad would spend a long, leisurely day driving to the lake, and then taking his small boat out on the water. It was quiet and peaceful for the most part. Those memories remain some of her most cherished moments of her life.\n \nChris has a friend called Robert. On this day, Robert invited Chris to join him on his company's fishing trip. Robert said it wouldn't cost much, but would be a lot of fun. He knew Chris enjoyed lake fishing and figured she would have a great time. \"Okay,\" said Chris, and to the ocean they went.\nThe first thing Chris noticed, however, was the motion. \"Wow, this boat really rocks,\" Chris told Robert. \"Don't worry about it. You will get used to it,\" he said. The trip to the waters off Catalina Island took about an hour. Chris marveled at how quickly she lost sight of the mainland. It was a bit scary when she thought about how alone they were in this great ocean.  Soon, it was time to collect squid for bait. The small boat stopped in the water, and the crew turned the bright light into the ocean to attract the squid. Before long, thousands of squid rose to the surface and were collected for bait.\nAfter about an hour, Chris didn't feel the rocking motion anymore. They were ready to fish. Chris caught her first ocean trout. It was a beautiful day.","summary":"A nostalgic reflection on a girl's transition from lake fishing with her dad to her first deep sea fishing trip with a friend, capturing the essence of cherished memories and new experiences.","image_description":"An image of a serene lake with a small boat on the water, juxtaposed with a vast ocean expanse with a fishing boat and crew collecting squid for bait under the bright sunlight."}}]}

When I turned 24 years old, my father lent me his car to go from Los Angeles to Chicago. I told my dad that my friend George was going with me, and he was bringing his girlfriend Nancy. My dad liked that George was going, because he was a responsible young adult, which made me think that my dad doesn't think of me as an adult. When the day we were scheduled to leave arrived, George's girlfriend didn't arrive at my house until 5 p.m. when we agreed we would meet at 2 p.m.\n \nIt wasn't bad. I had been waiting for this road trip for a year. I could wait a little longer. When Nancy arrived, we packed up her suitcase and hit the road. I was friends with both of them, but George was my friend first. I started getting annoyed with them right away. Even though I had my music playing in the car, I could still hear them in the back kissing and calling each other baby, sweetie, sweetheart, and other nauseating cute names. I didn't like it, but what was I going to do?\nGeorge took over the wheel after we left California. He was talking to Nancy the whole time. When we got near the Grand Canyon, Nancy started talking about how she always wanted to go see it. That was when George said those seven words I hated the most, \"What my baby wants, my baby gets.\" He started going down a road that led to the Grand Canyon without even asking me. I started to get really annoyed, but decided not to say anything. It was really late, but they didn't care. It turned out the road that led to the Grand Canyon closed after a certain time. Nancy felt embarrassed, and George started apologizing to me. After we got back on the highway, I drove all the way to Chicago. George knew that I was bugged, so he tried to keep me company. He even told Nancy to sit in the back, which she did. It was a horrible drive.

I remember the first time I went to a drive-in. I was 18 years old and was dating my future wife Caroline. We went on a double-date with my best friend Alfred and his girl Jeannie. The drive-in we visited that night was called the Starlight. It was close to home, and it had the best sound system of all the drive-ins. It also had a huge screen. We went to see \"Forrest Gump\" that night, mainly because Carol wanted to see it. \"I heard it is a great movie,\" she said. I really didn't know anything about the movie, but I did want to see something.\n \n\"Forrest Gump\" was indeed one of the best movies ever made. It had everything -- humor, drama, tragedy, and triumph. It is a great film.

Alfred and Jeannie were busy kissing in the back seat, which is another advantage of going to a drive-in.\nThose old drive-ins were around for decades, but soon after \"Forrest Gump\" came out, many of them started closing. They closed because of the new multiplex theaters popping up all over the country. People had a choice of many films to watch at those theaters, and soon the drive-in was gone.

A good language learner always looks for opportunities to talk with other students.\nMake notes during every class. Notes help you to remember new language. Look at your notes when you do your homework.\nUse a dictionary. Good language learners often use dictionaries to check the meaning of words they don't know. They also make their own vocabulary lists.\nThink in the language you're learning outside the classroom. When you're shopping or walking down the street, remember useful words and phrases. Sometimes, when you're at home, say new words to practise your pronunciation.\nDo extra practice. Test and improve your language, reading and listening skills with self-study material. You can find a lot of this online.\nImagine yourself speaking in the language. Many good language learners can see and hear themselves speaking in the language. This helps their motivation.\nEnjoy the process. Good language learners have fun with the language. Watch a TV series or film, listen to songs, play video games or read a book.

My parents always talked about going to New York, but we never went. I loved a lot of things about New York, but one thing that I really wanted to see was the Statue of Liberty. My parents aren't from the United States, but I was born here. They saw the Statue of Liberty as something more, not just as something people wanted to go see and take pictures of.\n \nMy parents never saw the Statue of Liberty because we lived in Texas. They crossed the border, and longed to see the Statue of Liberty with their own eyes, but never got the chance. I decided that I was going to fulfill their dream. I finally saved enough money for a plane ticket, and went to stay with a friend that I had met at home but now in New York. We talked over the Internet, and she told me that if I ever got the chance to go to New York, I could stay with her. I called her the day I got my plane ticket.\n\"Guess who's going to New York,\" I said. She started yelling and saying that it was going to be a lot of fun. I told her that my first stop had to be the Statue of Liberty. She told me that she couldn't wait. When I got out of the plane, I couldn't believe how cold it was. I got my luggage and met my friend outside of the airport. I hugged her and we got a taxi to take us to her home.\nWhen we got to her house, she showed me her room and told me we would be leaving for the Statue of Liberty in an hour. I took a shower and put on two sweaters. We got a taxi, and went to see the Statue of Liberty. It took a while, but we finally got to the island. I couldn't believe the Statue of Liberty was right before my eyes. I started crying, and felt my parents were right here with me. I always felt like a foreigner in this country even though I was born here. Now I understood why they wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty so much.","summary":"A heartfelt account of a journey to New York to fulfill the dream of seeing the Statue of Liberty, inspired by the narrator's parents' longing to visit the iconic landmark.","image_description":"An emotional moment at the Statue of Liberty, with the narrator in awe of the statue, shedding tears of joy as they finally fulfill their parents' dream."}}]}
