  "passage": "One of the first things Gustav wanted to do when he got to the United States was to see as much of it as he could. He would be flying into New York City's John F. Kennedy airport. In New York he planned to see the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty. Then he wanted to go to Philadelphia to see the Liberty Bell. Then he wanted to go to the nation's capital, Washington D.C., where he hoped to see the White House, and maybe he would even see President. He knew that getting to the three east coast cities was pretty easy. He could take a train or bus.\n \nGustav wasn't sure though about how he would get to the other parts of the United States he wanted to see. For example, Gustav really wanted to see the Grand Canyon in Arizona. He also really wanted to go to Los Angeles to see where some of his favorite movie stars lived.\nOnce in New York City Gustav asked the hotel concierge if they could arrange some trips for him. The concierge was helpful and informed Gustav about the different Amtrak trains he could take to Philadelphia and Washington D.C. \"What about the Grand Canyon and Hollywood?\" Gustav asked. \"What about them?\" the concierge asked, looking confused. \"What about trips there?\" Gustav asked. The concierge pulled out a map and showed Gustav how far Arizona and California are from New York. \"A train there will take you about a week. A plane ride will take about six hours,\" the concierge explained. Gustav was disappointed. He had no idea that the United States was such a large country. He was determined to see as much as he could though. He wondered how much it would cost to rent a camper and drive it across the U.S."
