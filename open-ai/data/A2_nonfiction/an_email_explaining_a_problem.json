  "passage": "From: Jameela Lee\nTo: Professor Kim Hart\nSubject: Absence from class for two weeks\nAttached: doctor's_certificate.pdf\nDear Professor Hart,\nI'm writing to let you know that I can't attend class for two weeks as I've had an accident and hurt my back. I'm afraid I also need to ask for an extension for next week's essay.\nI have medicine for the pain but I can't get up or walk around much, and the doctor said I should stay in bed and rest as much as possible. This makes reading and studying very difficult for me at the moment. I've attached a copy of the doctor's certificate and I hope to be back in class from 12 May.\nUntil then, my friend is going to record the lectures so I can listen to them at home. I will try to catch up with all the reading too. However, I don't think I can submit the essay next week. Is it possible to have an extension?\nThank you for your understanding.\nRegards,\nJameela\n(ENG101 class)\n"
