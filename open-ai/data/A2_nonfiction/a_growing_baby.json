It poops a lot. It sleeps a lot. It tries to talk. It makes funny sounds. It says \"Googoo\" and \"Gaga.\" It waves its arms and legs. It doesn't do much else. It doesn't sit up. It doesn't stand up. It doesn't talk. It lies on its back. It lies on its stomach. After a year, it will do many things. It will crawl. It will stand up. It will walk. It will talk. But in the beginning, it just grows. It grows bigger and bigger."
