  "passage": "To: Meena\nFrom: Suki\nSubject: What to do while we're away\nHi Meena,\nThank you so much for offering to house sit for us next week. I'm only sorry we won't get to catch up properly until we get back from our trip. Anyway, here's everything I won't have time to tell you on Saturday morning.\nThe alarm code is 7957. Don't forget to set it when you go out and remember to turn it off when you get back home as it is LOUD!\nThe rabbits need feeding once a day and under no circumstances should they be allowed out of their cage in the garden as the neighbour's cats have attacked them in the past.\nPlease can you use the washing machine in the daytime only as it's old and noisy and the neighbours complain otherwise?\nWould you mind opening all the upstairs windows for an hour in the morning as the house gets damp at this time of year?\nThat's about it! You'll find everything you need in the house, and help yourself to anything in the fridge or cupboards. Feel free to call or text if you have any problems/questions.\nSee you briefly to hand over keys on Saturday morning and looking forward to a proper chat when we get back!\nThanks again!\nSuki"
