But Margaret Allen’s does. After a gentle warm-up and a few pulse-raising numbers, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her charges rehydrate with a cup of tea and a quick sit down. \\nSome of the eight-strong class look as if they need it more than others. Allen herself, wearing a thick turquoise shirt, navy knitted waistcoat, black slacks and sensible shoes, has not broken into a sweat. Despite an “excruciating” trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement, she looks as though she could go on for hours. \\nThe general rule is that eating directly before sport is not the best idea, let alone part way through. But, on the afternoon I visit Allen’s class at a church hall in Saltburn-by-the-Sea near Middlesbrough, slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break. The cake has been baked in honour of Allen’s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, Joan, known locally as the “scone queen of Saltburn”. \\nThe ladies have barely swallowed their last crumb when Allen is up again, leading the group through a jaunty Scottish number involving lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. Forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over. \\nAllen, a former volunteer with the Red Cross, has been leading classes in the north-east seaside town for 45 years. Not particularly sporty at school, she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war – “just for something to do during the blackouts, really” – and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired. At its peak, Allen’s class had more than 18 regulars, each paying £1 a time. But, these days, her flock is diminishing fast – during the teabreak, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them had attended that week for one of the younger members of the group who had just died, aged 68, from motor neurone disease. \\nAllen is the oldest, followed by her sister. The baby of the group is 60-year-old Jean Cunion, who credits the group with supporting her through a difficult time when her mother died. She is somewhat embarrassed to admit that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. “I remember, the first time I came, Margaret said: 'Who’s that huffing and panting?' and I had to admit it was me.” Ruth Steere, 76, marvels at how Allen never misses a trick, despite always having her back to the class: “She always shouts at us if we go wrong. She’s remarkably good at knowing what we are doing.” \\nAllen, a keen dancer, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. Instead, she choreographs her own moves based on five tapes from the BBC’s first ever fitness guru, Eileen Fowler, who died in 2000 when she was 93, Allen’s age now. Allen thinks her good health is largely down to keeping busy, especially since her husband Joe died in 1997. She took up writing poetry when she was 80. \\n“I write poems about everything. I’m a prolific writer. I just can’t stop,” she says, phoning me a few days after the interview to read out a ditty she has written about the joys of exercise. One of the class, 84-year-old former teacher Winnie Robertson, thinks the secret to staying fit is never letting yourself go: “Use it or lose it, that’s what I say.” \\nAllen still plays the piano and gives speeches. She is president of the Women’s Fellowship at the local methodist church and is one of three 90-plus year olds at the scrabble club of the University of the Third Age. She did a computer course when she was 88 and tried to get online, but it didn’t work out. \\nAgeing is no fun, she admits, reading me a few lines from a poem she has written called 'That Beast Called Age'. She happily recalls a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years back, who said she couldn’t possibly be more than 78: “I said, 'Thank you, doctor. You can go now.'” \\nShe also has a no-nonsense attitude to weight gain: “I just think people shouldn’t eat too much. Whenever I hear someone saying, 'Oh, I can’t lose weight’, I say:’ Sellotape.'” She mimes taping her mouth shut. “I said this just the other day to a big fat man. Everything in moderation is my motto.” \\nEarlier in 2013, Allen was watching the news and saw a woman being given the British Empire Medal. I think she means Margaret Chartwood from Horley, who was given the honour in January, at the age of 77. “She was saying: 'I’m 80 and I’m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!' I was thinking: 'No, you’re not.' But I shan’t be writing to Buckingham Palace.”\\n\",\"summary\":\"Follow the inspiring journey of 93-year-old Margaret Allen, a fitness instructor and poet, as she defies age stereotypes and continues to lead exercise classes in her community.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of Margaret Allen leading her exercise class, surrounded by elderly participants enjoying a tea break with slices of fruitcake.\"}"}]}

The great man stares northwards across the square at an almost sheer mountainside in front of him. \\nBehind him, to the south, rises the equally sheer 1,800-metre peak known as Gaustatoppen. Between the mountains, along the narrow Vestfjord valley, lies the small, but once mighty, town that Eyde built in the early years of the last century, to house the workers for his factories. \\nEyde harnessed the power of the 100-metre Rjukanfossen waterfall to generate hydroelectricity in what was, at the time, the world’s biggest power plant. \\nBut one thing he couldn’t do was change the elevation of the sun. Deep in its east –west valley, surrounded by high mountains, Rjukan and its 3,400 inhabitants are in shadow for half the year. During the day, from late September to mid-March, the town, three hours north-west of Oslo, is not completely dark, but it’s certainly not bright, either. \\nRecently, however, Eyde’s statue has gazed out upon a sight that even he might have found startling. High on the mountain opposite, 450 metres above the town, three large, solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors steadily track the movement of the sun across the sky, reflecting its rays down on to the square and bathing it in bright sunlight. \\n“It’s the sun!” grins Ingrid Sparbo, disbelievingly, lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes. A retired secretary, Sparbo has lived all her life in Rjukan and says people “do sort of get used to the shade. You end up not thinking about it, really. But this ... this is so warming. Not just physically, but mentally. It’s mentally warming.” \\nTwo young mothers wheel their children into the square and stand in the sun. On a freezing day, an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches, smiling at the warmth on their faces. Children beam. Lots of people take photographs. A shop assistant, Silje Johansen, says it’s “awesome. Just awesome.” \\nPushing his child’s buggy, electrical engineer Eivind Toreid is more cautious. “It’s a funny thing,” he says. “Not real sunlight, but very like it. Like a spotlight.” \\nHeidi Fieldheim says she heard all about it on the radio. “But it’s far more than I expected,” she says. “This will bring much happiness.” \\nAcross the road, in the Nye Tider café, sits the man responsible for this unexpected access to happiness. Martin Andersen is a 40-year-old artist who moved to Rjukan in the summer of 2001. \\nThe first inkling of an artwork Andersen called the Solspeil , or Sun mirror , came to him as the month of September began to fade: “Every day, we would take our young child for a walk in the buggy,” he says, “and, every day, I realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun.” By 28 September, the sun completely disappears from Rjukan’s market square. It doesn’t reappear until 12 March. \\nThroughout the seemingly endless intervening months, Andersen says, “We’d look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain slopes, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town. It’s sad, a town that people have to leave in order to feel the sun.” \\nTwelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil, a German company specializing in so-called CSP – concentrated solar power – helicoptered in the three 17-sq-m glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan. “It took,” he says, “a bit longer than we’d imagined.” \\nIt really works. There were objectors – and plenty of them – petitions and letter-writing campaigns and a Facebook page organized against what a large number of locals saw initially as a vanity project and, above all, a waste of money. But even they now seem largely won over. \\n“I was strongly against it,” admits Nils Eggerud. Like many others, he felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere – on a couple of extra carers to look after Rjukan’s old people, perhaps, or improved school facilities, cycle paths, a bit of rural road resurfacing. \\n“And I still have my doubts about the ongoing maintenance costs,” he says. “What will they be, who will pay them? But ... well, it does feel nice, standing here. And, really, you just have to look at the people’s faces.” \\nIn his office overlooking the square, Rjukan’s energetic young mayor, Steinar Bergsland, is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town. \\nAlready, Bergsland says, visitor numbers are up for the time of year and Rjukan’s shopkeepers have reported their takings following suit. A hi-tech company is interested in relocating to Rjukan, attracted by the cutting-edge technology on view at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted. \\n“This is a powerful symbol for Rjukan,” Bergsland says, and, helped by assorted government grants and a donation from a local business, the town needed to find just 1m krone – £100,000 – of the mirrors’ total 5m-krone cost. \\nAnd, seen against the town’s 650m krone annual budget, he points out, 1m krone really wasn’t very much to pay for something that “gives us a far, far better chance of raising the money we need for better schools and more nursing care. And just look out of the window. Look at those happy faces. Now it’s actually here, people love it.”  \\n\",\"summary\":\"The story of how an artist's vision and innovative technology brought sunlight to a town shrouded in darkness for half the year, transforming the lives of its inhabitants.\",\"image_description\":\"An artist's rendering of the three large, solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors reflecting sunlight onto the market square of Rjukan, Norway, with joyful townspeople basking in the light.\"}"}]}

He died in 1946, six years before she was born. But, on Tuesday 8th April, 2014, she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle, 101 years after he had lobbed it into the Baltic Sea. Thought to be the world’s oldest message in a bottle, it was presented to Erdmann by the museum that is now exhibiting it in Germany. \\n“It was very surprising,” Erdmann, 62, said, recalling how she found out about the bottle. “A man stood at my door and told me he had post from my grandfather. He then told me that a message in a bottle had been found and that the name that was on the card was that of my grandfather.” Her visitor was a genealogical researcher who had managed to track her down in Berlin after the letter was given to the International Maritime Museum in the northern port city of Hamburg. \\nThe brown beer bottle, which had been in the water for 101 years, was found in the catch of Konrad Fischer, a fisherman, who had been out in the Baltic Sea off the northern city of Kiel. Holger von Neuhoff, curator for ocean and science at the museum, said this bottled message was the oldest he had come across. “There are documents that have been found without the bottle that are older and are in the museum,” he said. “But, with the bottle and the document, this is certainly the oldest at the moment. It is in extremely good condition.” \\nResearchers believe Erdmann’s grandfather, Richard Platz, threw the bottle in the sea while on a hike with a nature appreciation group in 1913. He was 20 years old at the time. \\nMuch of the postcard was indecipherable, although the address in Berlin on the front of the card was legible, as was the author’s polite request that the note be sent by the finder to his home address. \\n“He also included two stamps from that time that were also in the bottle, so the finder would not incur a cost,” Erdmann said. “But he did not think it would take 101 years.” \\nShe said she was moved by the arrival of the message, although she had not known her grandfather because he died, at the age of 54, six years before she was born. \\n“I knew very little about my grandfather, but I found out that he was a writer who was very open-minded, and believed in freedom and that everyone should respect each other,” she said. “He did a lot for the young and later travelled with his wife and two daughters. It was wonderful because I could see where my roots came from.” \\nLike her grandfather, Erdmann said, she also liked culture and travelling around the world. She described herself as open-minded, too. “What he taught his two daughters, my mother taught me and I have then given to my sons,” she said. Despite her joy at receiving the bottled message, she said that she hoped others would not repeat what her grandfather had done and throw bottles with messages into the sea. “Today, the sea is so full of so many bottles and rubbish that more shouldn’t be thrown in there,” she said. \\nThe message and the bottle will be on display at Hamburg’s Maritime Museum until the beginning of May 2014, after which experts will attempt to decipher the rest of the text. It is not clear what will then happen to the bottle, but Erdmann hopes it will stay at the museum. \\n“We want to make a few photos available to put with the bottle and give it a face, so visitors can see the young man who threw the bottle into the water,” she said.  \\n\",\"summary\":\"Angela Erdmann receives a 101-year-old message in a bottle from her grandfather, leading to a heartwarming connection to her family's past.\",\"image_description\":\"An old brown beer bottle with a postcard inside, found in the Baltic Sea, displayed in a museum alongside a portrait of Angela Erdmann's grandfather.\"}"}]}

I just picked it up,” Louise Haggerty, a 56-year-old hairdresser and waitress, said of her 1am trip to the Black Friday sales. “It was mental in there. It was crazy. It was absolutely disgusting, disgusting.” \\nHaggerty had ventured out to the 24-hour Sainsbury’s supermarket in Harringay, north-east London with a friend in the hope of snapping up a bargain flat-screen TV. “But so many people pushed in the queue we didn’t have a chance,” she said. “The poor woman who was second in the queue was pushed out by a crowd of youths. She didn’t get anything. People were behaving like animals – it was horrible,” she said. “I only saw two security guards.” \\nFrustrated with not being able to buy a Blaupunkt 40” TV reduced from £299.99 to £149.99, Haggerty rushed to pick up a Dyson Animal Vac, down from £319.99 to £159.99. “I don’t even know how much it costs; I don’t know even know if I’m going to buy it. I just wanted something,” she said. “There are lads in there with three, four, five tellies. It’s not fair.” \\nOne of those lads was Andy Blackett, 30, an estate agent, who had two trolleys full of bargains. “I got two coffee makers, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo,” he said. “I couldn’t tell you the prices but I know they’re bargains.” But his mate Henry Fischer, a 19-year-old student, wasn’t as successful. “Someone snatched my telly from me – it’s cos I’m the smaller one.” \\nBlackett, Fischer and some mates had driven to Sainsbury’s at 12.45am after retreating from the “bedlam” of Tesco’s 24-hour Lea Valley supermarket, where the Black Friday sale started at midnight. “Tesco was scary so we came here instead,” Blackett said. \\nMore than a dozen police officers attended the Tesco store on Glover Drive, Upper Edmonton, as scuffles broke out between eager and frustrated shoppers. Customers were seen tearing down cardboard hoardings put in place to hold back sale items until the stroke of midnight. Tesco delayed the sale of its most popular sale items – TVs – for almost an hour until police brought the situation under control. One officer was overheard criticizing the manager for failing to ensure adequate security and suggested the sale should be suspended altogether. The Tesco store is across the road from an IKEA furniture store that was the scene of riots when it opened with a midnight sale in 2005. \\nPolice intervened at other stores, including Tesco in Willesden and Surrey Quays, just before the doors opened at midnight. Greater Manchester Police said at least two people had been arrested at Black Friday sales events already that morning. The force said on its Twitter feed: “Keep calm, people!” South Wales Police also reported receiving a number of calls from staff at Tesco stores after they became “concerned due to the volume of people who had turned up to sale events”. \\nOne of the first purchasers of a flat-screen TV, when TV sales began just before 1am, was James Alled, 30, a businessman, who bought two and was already negotiating to sell one of them to someone further down the queue. “I bought them for £250. I’ll sell it to you for £350, £300 cash,” he said. Further back in the queue, Christine Ball, 62, wasn’t impressed. “I got here at 10.15pm and I’m further back now than when I got here,” she said. “None of that lot know what a queue is.” \\nBall, who, like most of the shoppers, had not heard of the US-inspired Black Friday sales until now, said she had come out especially to buy her grandson a TV for Christmas. “Not one of those massive ones; just a normal one at £100 or so,” she said. In her basket was a pint of semi-skimmed and a loaf of bread. “Telly, milk and bread – the necessities,” she said. \\nMel Mehmet, 23, had been to Black Friday sales in 2013 and had expected queues but said the atmosphere in Tesco scared her this time. “It’s crazy, really, having it at midnight – the police must have more important things to do at night than be called to sales.

Jordan Axani, a 28-year-old Toronto real-estate developer turned charity founder, made it back to Canada with Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher but said the pair had “forged a brother-sister-like relationship”. \\nAxani had made headlines in 2014 after offering an air ticket to any Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher. He had booked a three-week vacation with his ex-girlfriend but, after they split up, he was unable to change the name on the flights. \\nThat’s where Axani’s new travelmate, a 23-year-old student from Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, came in. Gallagher, who goes by the name Quinn, replied to a Reddit post Axani had submitted – along with other hopeful Elizabeth Gallaghers – and was selected. Gallagher had made it clear before the trip that she had a “pretty serious” boyfriend but that had not stopped romantics, and journalists, from hoping the globetrotters might fall for one another. Unfortunately, it was not to be. \\n“It wasn’t easy and it certainly wasn’t immediate. It took us about a week to really figure each other out,” Axani said. There was a certain amount of “natural stumbling” around “the dos and don’ts of travelling together” as the pair got to know each other.\\n“I’m going to be explicitly clear,” Axani said, shortly after the pair returned to Toronto. “This was never a romantic endeavour. It was strictly platonic. I do not think of Quinn in a romantic light in the least. There is no future for us romantically. She is a good friend. I think of her as a little sister but that will be it. And her feelings are entirely mutual in that regard.” It took work to establish that brother-sister, good-friend, no-future-for-us-romantically relationship, however. other. “At the end of it, we’d developed a really great rhythm of, one second, having really funny inside jokes, and, the next second, knowing when the other needed space.” \\nAlthough the pair failed to fall for one another, Axani said the trip, which took in Milan, Venice, Vienna, Prague, Khao Lak (in Thailand) and Hong Kong, was “fantastic”. A favourite place was Prague, Axani said, where they “had the largest groundswell of people reaching out”. \\n“Over the course of two and a half days, I think we met about two dozen people. So that’s a lot of stories, that’s a lot of individuals and that’s a lot of love for their home city of Prague.” \\nPeople were following the pair on Twitter and Instagram, Axani said, and they were even recognized in the street in Hong Kong. “It was a real adventure. We had a blast. We learned a lot about ourselves and about each other. I think, coming out of it, I can’t imagine it going much better than it did.” \\nAxani made it back to Toronto at 3am on Monday, 12 January, when the holiday came to an abrupt halt. He went straight into a board meeting with fellow board members at his charity, A Ticket Forward. Axani started the non-profit organization after his Reddit post went viral and intends to offer round-the-world-trips to survivors of abuse, cancer and war. \\nAlongside that, Axani is also in talks to spin his story into a television show or film, although he would not comment on what form those productions might take. “Suffice to say there’s been significant interest from many production companies. We’re well advanced.” In terms of his love life, Axani said he was not looking for his next Elizabeth Gallagher just yet. “I’m not looking for anything, per se, but life happens and we’ll see,” he said. “As always, life’s a journey.” \\n\",\"summary\":\"Follow the story of Jordan Axani, a Canadian man who offered a round-the-world trip to a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend, and discover how their platonic relationship unfolded during the adventure.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of Jordan Axani and Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher exploring a bustling city together, showcasing their platonic travel companionship.\"}"}]}

There was a woman in the water with Dusty, a dolphin who has a great relationship with a group of people she regularly swims with. \\nDusty arrived in Doolin in about 2008 and hundreds of people have swum with her since, giving the impression that she’s totally tame. She has even starred in an Irish tourist-board ad campaign in which a girl says she would like to touch a dolphin. \\nThat evening, this woman was tickling Dusty’s tummy and it just looked so inviting. There were about 20 tourists and locals on the pier, looking at this lovely spectacle. Just after I got into the water, Dusty left the woman she was with and went ballistic – I found out afterwards that she’s very territorial when she is with somebody. Her tail was flapping wildly and, at first, I thought it was a display but, then, I twigged: maybe she’s angry. I knew I had to get out of the water so I swam towards the pier but, within microseconds, Dusty had ploughed into me with her snout. It was very powerful and painful, and the speed was amazing. I went hurtling forwards. \\nAll these people on the pier were staring down at me open-mouthed. Dusty was still in the water beside me, her tail flapping crazily. That was more frightening than anything: I thought, if she hits me with her tail, I could go under; I’m gone. \\nI was at the pier but couldn’t get out because of my injuries. I felt pure terror. I shouted for help and a guy put his arm in and pulled me out on to the steps. Then, another man appeared and said he was an orthopaedic surgeon who specialized in marine trauma. He had been driving into Doolin when he saw what was happening on the pier. I was so cold and very worried – I didn’t know how bad my injuries were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding. He checked me over and was very reassuring, saying he couldn’t feel any evidence of it but that I probably had broken bones. I found out later that I had six spinal fractures, three broken ribs and a damaged lung. \\nI was in hospital for five days, in a back brace for several weeks and off work for five months with limited mobility, stiffness and pain. Then, I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. My near-death experience had left me anxious about everything and overreacting in a way I had never done before. I felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way, I began to struggle with loud noises and I suffered from memory loss. Three months before the accident, I had opened a health-food shop but I had to let it go because I could no longer work. It was the toughest year ever but, now, it’s all behind me. I had craniosacral therapy, osteopathy and massage, and am building up my own osteopathy practice now. I have a new empathy with patients because I have been one. \\nI am grateful that I am healthy and I really want to prevent other people being injured. We have this lovely idea about dolphins and have faith in them – who would think a dolphin would ever attack a person? If you see a ferocious animal coming at you with its teeth bared, it’s scary, but dolphins have this lovely, wide smile. \\nI don’t have any anger towards Dusty. I respect her. But I was in her territory and she’s a wild, unpredictable animal. People need to know that. So many come here to swim with her and they don’t understand how dangerous it can be. Mine were reportedly among several injuries that summer. \\nAfter the man pulled me out of the water, Dusty swam away but, then, she came back and was bobbing vertically next to me, looking at me. We locked eyes and I felt there was complete remorse in her. She was a totally different dolphin; the anger had gone. The people on the pier were in awe. When she had that little moment with me, that was the end of the terror. I made my peace with her.  \",\"summary\":\"A recount of a terrifying encounter with a dolphin named Dusty while swimming off Doolin Pier in Ireland, leading to severe injuries and lasting trauma, but ultimately culminating in a sense of peace and understanding.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of a serene dolphin swimming in the ocean, juxtaposed with a person being rescued from the water by a man on a pier in County Clare, Ireland.\"}"}]}

But, in the hardest-hit parts of the EU, joblessness rates continue to creep up and the rhetoric does little to shorten the dole queue. \\nNow, in a struggling corner of Italy, one mayor thinks he has found an answer to his town’s chronic lack of work – although, rather than a solution, it appears to some to be more of an admission of defeat. Valter Piscedda, the centre- left mayor of Elmas, a small town near Sardinia’s capital, Cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave. The council will pay for ten unemployed locals to take intensive English lessons, board a cheap flight and look for jobs elsewhere in Europe. \\n“This is, above all, an idea born of common sense and experience,” he told the Guardian. “Over the past year and a half – especially in the past few months – I have been receiving young people, almost every day, who are despairing about their search for work. Some are looking here and ask for a hand in finding it here. Others have tried everything and are so discouraged that they no longer want to stay and wait. And they want to go and gain work experience abroad; life experience, too. \\n“So, my reasoning was this: put everything in place that the council administration can put in place so that those who want to gain experience abroad are able to,” he said. \\nAs the national economy continues to falter, Sardinia, along with much of southern and central Italy, is grappling with high unemployment, with the overall joblessness rate at 17.7% in the second quarter of 2014, according to Italy’s National Institute of Statistics, Istat. More than 54% of people under 25 are out of work. \\nFor the Adesso Parto (Now I’m leaving) programme, Elmas’s council has allocated €12,000 on a first-come, first-served basis to applicants aged between 18 and 50. As long as they are out of work and have lived in the town for three years, they are eligible. They do not have to be university educated and their annual income must be no more than €15,000. \\nThe idea of encouraging people to up sticks is sensitive at a time when floods of Italians – many of them bright young graduates – are leaving their country every year. But Piscedda, who belongs to the Democratic Party of the Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, denies he is facilitating a brain drain and believes that the people he is sending away may well return “and give me back 100 times what they were given”. More importantly, he wants the scheme to give a leg-up to those most in need. \\n“It’s a programme for those with no other resource; it’s the last-chance saloon. It’s about allowing them the dignity of not having to ask a friend for money or place burdens on families that cannot do it,” he said. \\nEarlier in 2014, he added, the council launched a scheme whereby businesses were given financial incentives to hire young workers from Elmas. “We advertised 20 of these positions,” he said. “We got 120 applications.” \\nIn Elmas, the scheme has provoked mixed reactions. “The reality is that there is little work here,” said Alessandro Macis. “The opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile. The son of a friend of mine who didn’t study much has ended up in London and he’s really finding his way. He started as a waiter. Now, he’s a cook and he’s learning English.” \\nOthers were perplexed. “I heard about it but I thought it was strange. If you have that money to pay for people to go away, why don’t you use that money to keep them here?” said Consuelo Melis, who works behind the bar in a local café. On Twitter, one of many reactions was disbelief. “The state’s admission of defeat,” commented Marco Patavino. “Institutions are raising the white flag,” remarked Carlo Mazzaggio. \\nPiscedda, however, is undeterred, remarking of his online critics: “Probably, they are people that aren’t in need ... Every day, I deal with people’s problems and I have to do something to try to solve them. These people, if they had an alternative, they wouldn’t be asking for help. \\n“The work I can create, as mayor, is temporary. I can have a piazza cleaned. I can have it cleaned again. I can have the streets cleaned. But these are all temporary things that give nothing beyond that little bit of money for a few months. I want to go beyond that.”\\n\",\"summary\":\"A mayor in a struggling town in Italy proposes a controversial solution to high unemployment rates by paying residents to leave and seek work abroad, sparking mixed reactions from the community.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of a small town in Italy with a group of young people discussing employment opportunities, while others appear skeptical in the background.\"}"}]}

Women can drink whatever we want,” she says. \\nNow Singerer, a childminder, has joined FemAle, a group of like-minded drinkers in Gothenburg, to launch Sweden’s first beer made by women. \\nWe Can Do It, a bottled pale ale, has just gone on sale in stores across Sweden. Its label is a take on Rosie the Riveter, the creation of a US Second World War propaganda campaign that went on to become a symbol of women’s power in the workplace. \\nThe group’s founder is Elin Carlsson, 25, who paints cars at the Volvo factory outside the city. “We Can Do It is not a female beer but a beer brewed by women that anyone can drink,” she says. “It’s nothing to do with feminism; it’s about equality – we wanted to show we can do it.” \\nFemAle is up against decades of prejudice in the beer world. In an irony not lost on FemAle, Carlsberg and other big brewers have spent millions in recent years trying to sell beer to women, attempting to “pink it and shrink it” to appeal to perceived feminine tastes. Carlsberg’s Eve and Copenhagen offerings, Foster’s Radler and Coors’s Animée were among lighter, flavoured and even “bloat-resistant” beers that failed to find a market. \\nFemAle’s approach is different, with women- only tastings that allow potential customers to experiment with flavours and styles of beer that they may not normally try. This education process is the way to “get more girls into the beer world”, the group says. “Bring your mother, sister, girlfriend, aunt and grandmother so we can all learn more about beer.” \\nThe idea for FemAle arose after the women kept bumping into each other at beer festivals. \\nWe Can Do It was the brainchild of Felicia Nordström, a bar worker who says she was fed up with bearded beer snobs telling her: “What do you know about beer, sweetie?” She approached FemAle and they teamed up with Ocean, a local independent micro-brewery. One weekend they concocted the recipe and the next they brewed 1,600 litres. \\n“This is not a beer that is aimed at women – it’s our hoppiest brew,” says Thomas Bingebo, the head brewer at Ocean. “When the big breweries target women, it usually fails. This is something completely different.” \\nThe first batch of We Can Do It was sold out almost before it was brewed. FemAle has already been approached by other breweries asking if they can brew new beers with them. \\nWe Can Do It uses three malts – Maris Otter, Amber and a Thomas Fawcett wheat malt – and the hop varieties Galaxy and Cascade. Its IBU, or bitterness level, is 65 and its alcohol content is 4.6%. \\n“Women opt for a glass of wine because they don’t know what beer is all about; they don’t know what to order,” says Carlsson. “We open up new worlds to them.” \\n“I used not to like stout but, back then, I only drank Pripps [a light, Swedish lager],” says Singerer, 38. “Guinness tastes like water to me now. There are imperial stouts that are like drinking biscotti dipped in espresso.” \\nThe women are part of a brewing explosion in Sweden, which is developing a passion for “craft” ales, bottled and on draught. The standard stor stark (large strong) lager is now “almost extinct” in Gothenburg, the women say, as pubs and bars replace the big brands with a choice of specialist beers. \\n“All the girls are different – there is no typical woman beer-lover. Anyone can do it,” says Emma Henriksson, 22, a group member who works in a garden equipment company. \\n“Every pub wants to learn how to reach women,” adds Singerer. “And Elin has found the way. It’s awesome. We feel so proud.”  \\n\",\"summary\":\"Follow the journey of FemAle, a group of women in Gothenburg, as they challenge stereotypes in the beer industry and launch Sweden's first beer brewed by women, promoting equality and education about craft beer.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of a group of diverse women with bottles of beer in hand, standing in front of a brewery.

It’s a fact that’s covered in a government-led review, released in May 2016, in which workers, employers and customers were asked their views on the tipping process. Off the back of it, ministers said they were keen to change rules and make sure low-paid workers get the money left for them by grateful customers. The government have announced a two-month consultation on proposals that they said would stamp out unfairness. \\nAmong the review’s revelations was the fact that some waiters are charged up to a 15% administration fee on tips they are left by credit or debit cards. In some restaurants, the government has seen evidence of waiters being forced to hand over their own cash, if they don’t collect enough tips, to cover these fees. The government said it would consider prohibiting employers from charging workers an admin fee or any other deductions. \\nThe government also said that it wanted customers to know that tips are voluntary, calling for the system to be made more transparent, with restaurants clearly displaying their tips policy. \\nWe asked waiters around the UK what they think of the tipping process (including how much they take home from tips and whether it’s fair) and what would improve it for them. \\n1. Rodri, 37, London: 'Around 50% of a waiter’s income is tips' \\nAverage tips: £60 per eight-hour shift \\nI think they treat waiters best in ... the US Everything has got fairer since the tipping scandal was exposed in the summer of 2015. This is when it was revealed that dozens of restaurants were exposed for skimming tips from staff for administration fees. However, you still hear horror stories from new employees at some chains. I’ve heard of restaurants not paying their chefs a share of the tronc (a payment arrangement used to distribute tips). Some restaurants will take 4% of all sales to pay the chefs and as an admin fee. So, if you sell £1,000 worth of food, the company will take £40. This is regardless of how much you make in tips. This means that if a table has a £100 bill and doesn’t tip, the waiter has to pay £4 of their own money. This leads to a money-grabbing culture and, ironically, to bad service. If a table doesn’t tip, the waiter feels as if they are being robbed by the company and ends up resenting the customers. \\nI can average around £60 in tips per shift but, on a good night, this goes up to over £100 and, on a poor night, it’s around £40. Around 50% of a waiter’s income is tips. All restaurants should have to publicly state their exact tipping procedure. America has it pretty good – everyone tips. \\n2. Elle, 22, Edinburgh: 'We never know whether it’s fair' \\nAverage tips: £20 per eight-hour shift \\nI think they treat waiters best in ... France \\nI work three jobs, all on part-time zero-hours contracts, in catering and hospitality. My main day job is in a café where the small number of staff work both front of house and in the kitchen so all our tips get put in a pot and shared equally. My main evening job is at a restaurant where we don’t get our tips but our wages are minimum wage plus an extra £2.50 per hour (which apparently has been worked out to account for average tips when shared with the kitchen staff). My third job is events catering and nobody ever tips. \\nIn restaurants, because a lot of customers add tips through card payments, the staff never actually see how much is getting tipped – so we don’t know whether we’re getting our fair share or not. The system seems better in France, where they don’t tip much but waiting tables is seen as a proper job, offering job security and a decent income. \\n3. Ashley, 22, London: 'Tips go towards customer breakages' \\nAverage tips: £10-15 per eight-hour shift \\nI think they treat waiters best in ... Australia \\nI work in a south-east London pub in the evenings and I do day shifts at a local restaurant. In both places, tips are all collected and shared out at the end of the night. Money is also taken from the tip jar to cover breakages by either staff or customers. If a member of the team gets off early, they will rarely see their tips because they are shared out just before the pub closes. \\nIt is incredibly unfair that our tips are shared out, especially when one member of the team underperforms. Equally, when a member of the team does incredibly well, they don’t get what they’ve earned. It’s really unfair that tips go towards breakages made by customers. The managers should have ways to pay for broken glasses and plates without docking our tips. I make around £20 a shift but would only be given £10-15 of that money. When I am tipped well, the tips hugely impact on my finances. Occasionally, I will earn over £50 in one night, which almost doubles my earnings for that day. However, I never get more than £30 of that money after it has been shared out. I really rely on tips because I am only paid £7 an hour. \\nI’d rather we earned a good basic wage (like in Australia) and therefore didn’t have to rely on tips to make ends meet. \\n4. Tom, Manchester: 'A big night of tips can help pay the rent' \\nAverage tips: £40 per eight-hour shift \\nI think they treat waiters best in ... Italy \\nWhere I used to work, floor staff kept 80% of cash tips and 40% of card tips. The other 20% of cash went into a pot for the commis waiters and service bar. The 60% went into a tronc system, which helped boost kitchen salaries. I’m not actually sure if this was to help pay the agreed salary or provide bonuses. \\nIt’s hard to say how much I earned a shift; maybe around £40, £20 from card tips. It can make a massive change to your weekly finances. Sometimes, people needed a big night to be able to pay their rent. \\nThey have got tipping right in Italy, where people don’t add a service charge but usually round up their bill so, if they get a meal for €19, they leave a €20 note and don’t ask for change. They respect the staff and you often see people making a career out of waiting and the experience shows.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Exploring the UK government's review on tipping practices in restaurants and waiters' experiences with tips, revealing issues like admin fees on tips and unfair tip distribution policies.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of a waiter holding a tray of food with a mix of cash and credit card tips, showcasing the complexities of tip distribution in restaurants.\"}"}]}

This article is meant for readers at the B1 CEFR language proficiency level."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"title\":\"The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth: A Look into America's 1%\",\"content\":\"Clay Cockrell is sitting in his office at Columbus Circle, across the street from 1 Central Park West, which houses Trump International Hotel and Tower. In front of the tower is Central Park, where Cockrell holds his popular walk and talk therapy sessions. \\nCockrell, a former Wall Street worker turned therapist, spends large parts of his days walking through Central Park or the Battery Park in downtown Manhattan near Wall Street, as a confidant and counsellor to some of New York’s wealthiest people. \\n“I shifted towards it naturally,” he said of his becoming an expert in wealth therapy. “Many of the extremely wealthy – the 1% of the 1% – feel that their problems are really not problems. But they are. A lot of therapists do not give enough weight to their issues.” \\nSo, what issues are America’s 1% struggling with? “There is guilt over being rich in the first place,” he said. “There is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich. And, then, there is the isolation – being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.” It seems F Scott Fitzgerald was right: the very rich “are different from you and me”. \\nCounsellors argue things have become worse since the financial crisis and the debate over income inequality that has been spurred on by movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Fight for $15 fair wage campaign. \\n“The Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative,” said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group. The media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich “feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed”. \\n“Sometimes, I am shocked by things that people say. You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders.” \\n“It’s really isolating to have a lot of money. People’s reactions to you can be scary,” said Barbara Nusbaum, an expert in money psychology. “We are all taught not to talk about money. It’s not polite to talk about money. Ironically, it’s harder to talk about having money than it is to talk about not having money. It’s much more socially acceptable to say 'I am broke. Things are hard.' You can’t say 'I have a ton of money.' You have to keep a lot of your life private.” \\nAs a result, Cockrell points out, the rich tend to hang out with other rich Americans, not out of snobbery but in order to be around those who understand them and their problems. \\nThe growing gap between the rich and poor is a global phenomenon. According to Oxfam, the richest 1% have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014 and are on track to own more than the other 99% by 2016. \\nIn the US, over the last three decades, the wealth owned by the top 0.1% households increased from 7% to 22% even as the wealth of the bottom 90% of households declined. \\nThe number of extremely wealthy people has also been climbing. According to research from Spectrem Group, in 2014, the number of US households with $1m or more in assets – excluding the value of their primary home – increased by 500,000 to 10.1m. In 2007, that number was 9.2m. Households worth $5m or more reached 1.3m and 142,000 households are now worth $25m or more. \\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, the income gap has expanded and the situation “has gotten worse for the wealthy”, Cockrell said. The main reason? Not knowing if your friends are friends with you or your money. \\n“Someone else who is also a billionaire – they don’t want anything from you. Never being able to trust your friendships with people of different means, I think that is difficult,” said Cockrell. “As the gap has widened, the rich have become more and more isolated.” \\nThese are real fears faced by the richest of the rich. In 2007, the Gates Foundation teamed up with Boston College’s Center on Wealth and Philanthropy to document what it felt like to be in America’s 1%. For the next four years, researchers surveyed 165 of America’s richest households – 120 of those households have at least $25m in assets. The average net worth of those surveyed was $78m. The resulting study, The Joys and Dilemmas of Wealth, was 500 pages long and seemed to prove the old adage that money can’t buy happiness. \\n“Wealth can be a barrier to connecting with other people,” confessed a spouse of a tech entrepreneur who made about $80m. Some Americans have taken to keeping their wealth secret. “We talk about it as stealth wealth. There are a lot of people that are hiding their wealth because they are concerned about negative judgment,” said Traeger-Muney. If wealthy Americans talk about the unique challenges that come with their wealth, people often dismiss their experience. \\n“People say 'Oh, poor you.' There is not a lot of sympathy there,” she said. “Wealth is still one of our last taboos.” \\nSpeaking in his soft, soothing voice that makes you want to spill all your worries, Cockrell said that a common mistake that many of his wealthy clients make is letting their money define them. \\n“I don’t think it’s healthy to discount your problems. If you are part of the 1%, you still have problems and they are legitimate to you. Even when you say, 'I don’t have to struggle for money', there are other parts of your life. Money is not the only thing that defines you,” he said. “Your problems are legitimate.”\\n\",\"summary\":\"Exploring the unique challenges and isolation faced by America's wealthiest individuals and the impact of wealth on personal relationships and well-being.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of Central Park with skyscrapers in the background, symbolizing the setting where wealth therapy sessions take place in Manhattan.\"}"}]}

Concerns were raised about lack of sleep and students finding it hard to study in their rooms. Air conditioning was suggested as a possible solution.\\nHowever, there is no budget left for installing air conditioning this academic year. Also, installation can only be carried out during holidays as students cannot be present in the building while the work takes place.\\nIssue 2: improving wheelchair access to Oak Café\\nIt was noted that wheelchair users can only access Oak Café from the back and not the front entrance nearer the lifts. This makes access to the café difficult for wheelchair users. The university is looking to improve its wheelchair access in general by installing ramps in key areas and work can take place during term time with no issues for staff or students.\\nConclusion and recommendations\\nTaking the factors mentioned into account, August would be the best time for the installation of air conditioning. Until then, the university could consider supplying fans to each second-floor room so students can sleep and study comfortably.\\nThe front of the café is recommended as an ideal place to install a wheelchair ramp.

So just as many religions ask people to abstain, or not to have certain foods or drinks for a certain time, many people are taking social media fasts. They are not updating their statuses, and they are also not reading what other people are posting. They choose to stay away from social media for 30 days.\\nIronically, the details of these fasts can be found on social networking sites all over the Internet. The reasons people undertake a fast are varied. Some people want to reconnect with their families or friends by disconnecting from their cell phones. Some people want to be more productive at work. What did some fasters do instead of logging on? Some decided to connect with friends by actually sitting down and having face-to-face conversations.

But it's noisy, not very pretty and not very Thai. For something more authentic, Phra Kanong offers an alternative place to stay, with its fantastic street markets where everyday Bangkok people eat, work and live.

Sure, you can easily take a taxi – if you want to spend hours stuck in traffic jams – but there are two much better ways to get around the city. To explore the temples and historical sites, catch an express boat river taxi or a longtail boat along the Chao Phraya river and the canals. For the modern part of the city, the Skytrain is a fast, cheap way to travel from the river to the shopping malls and nightlife of Sukhumvit, and the famous Chatuchak street market.\\nWhere to eat\\nThe simple answer is: everywhere! Thai street food is among the best in the world, and for around $5 you can eat a filling and delicious meal. Some food stands have little plastic seats where you can sit and eat and they cook the same dish over and over, like fried chicken on rice or Pad Thai noodles.

Earhart's story is one of controversy, and intriguing. She was an accomplished aviator, the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo. She accomplished this during a time when women were not highly regarded in the United States. American women during the 1930s did not have the same advantages men had. There were few employment opportunities. Educated women were a scarcity. Women who did find employment during this era were working as grade-school teachers, nannies, and maids for the most part. Amelia Earhart did a lot to change that perception.\\n \\nAlthough Earhart was born into a family that did see financial success, but that success was fleeting. There were times in her life when her family struggled to make ends meet because of poor money management. Earhart was home schooled for most of her life, and she gained her pilots license at an early age. In December of 1920, Earhart's father took Amelia to an airshow in Long Beach, California. This is where she first became interested in flying. After earning her aviator's license, she accomplished a feat that only a few men had ever done: flying solo across the Atlantic. She earned national fame for this and was soon a household name.\\nTragically, Earhart was lost in an attempt to fly around the world in 1937. She was never found. The theories about how she met her end are countless. Many think she fell victim to the Japanese prior to the start of World War II. This thinking was rooted in the idea that Earhart was a spy. Other outlandish theories include alien kidnapping, but most likely she had mechanical difficulties flying over the Pacific Ocean. Earhart was either killed instantly, or survived, according to one popular theory, and lived out her days on a deserted island.\",\"summary\":\"Explore the controversial and intriguing life of Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, who challenged gender norms and inspired a generation of women aviators.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of a vintage airplane flying over the ocean with a silhouette of a female aviator in the cockpit.\"}"}]}

The main cause was Southern states feeling that the U.S. federal government in Washington D.C. should not have the power to tell them what to do. This was especially true about two issues, taxes and slavery. The Southern economy was based on agriculture while the Northern economy was based on manufacturing. Southern crops like cotton were sold to factories and then Southerners had to pay taxes on the finished goods sold back to them like clothing. Many Southerners felt this was unfair. Additionally the agricultural economy in the south was reliant on the labor of enslaved Africans and their descendants. Many people, especially from the North, felt this was wrong and that slavery needed to be abolished. Southerners felt the abolitionists were threatening their way of life. Seven Southern slave states, banded together, declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America. The government in Washington D.C. and its army was known as the Union, since they were fighting to keep the country united.\\n \\nAbraham Lincoln was president of the United States during the Civil War. The President of the Confederate States was Jefferson Davis. The first battle was the Battle of Fort Sumter. During the war President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate States of America. This action was supposed to show that Lincoln was still in charge of the entire United States.\\nThe Civil War was the bloodiest war fought inside the United States. 620,000 were killed and millions more were injured. One of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War was the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. 51,000 people from both sides died, more than in any other battle. The Civil War ended in 1865 when General Robert E. Lee of the Confederate Army surrendered.\",\"summary\":\"Discover the events of the American Civil War, from its causes to its conclusion, including key battles and the impact on the nation.\",\"image_description\":\"An illustration depicting soldiers from the Union and Confederate armies engaged in battle, with smoke and cannons in the background.\"}"}]}

He almost single-handedly invented the home run, which is baseball's most cherished feat. Before Ruth, the home run was a novelty. It was a game of strategy, but the Babe changed all that.\\n \\nRuth was born in a rough section of Baltimore, Maryland in 1895. Much of his childhood has been lost to history. He spent a number of years at St. Mary's reformatory school after being labeled as \\\"incorrigible.\\\" His behavior was thought to be beyond rehabilitation. When exactly he got his start in baseball is also a mystery. Some accounts offer that he was placed on St. Mary's baseball team by the coach of the time. One popular story has Ruth being sent to the school because of his natural ability to hit a baseball. The story is that Ruth broke many windows while playing baseball on the streets, and that is why he was sent to the school in the first place.\\nBefore the 1920s, baseball was a slow game that included advancing players around the bases by strategically hitting the ball within the park. Ruth came in and was soon hitting balls out of the ballpark to the delight of the fans in attendance. The home run became an integral part of the game. Ruth earned several nicknames because of his power, including the \\\"Bambino,\\\" and the \\\"Sultan of Swat.\\\"\\nWhen Ruth was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees in a very unpopular move, the Yankees won seven World Series championships in his 12 years. Ruth made headlines for his after-hours antics in New York City as well. His drinking, and womanizing are well-documented.

This article is meant for readers at the B1 CEFR language proficiency level."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"title\":\"Interrupting the Media: A Revolution in Diverse Voices\",\"content\":\"Cameron Russell aims to open up the media landscape to divergent voices a little bit at a time. In March, she helped launch Interrupt magazine, initially a webzine, so these other perspectives can join in the media conversation. Its first issue is devoted to body image.\\nRussell is familiar with how women are portrayed in the media. She has been a model for brands such as Victoria's Secret, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Benetton and has appeared in the pages of Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and W.\\nShe is also known for her TEDx talk, Looks Are n't Everything, about those who win the genetic lottery and how society rewards the conventionally beautiful.\\nTo celebrate Interrupt magazine's launch, she's inviting the public to an art lab called You Are a Genius on New York's Lower East Side through Monday. It's at 215 Bowery St.\\nCNN spoke recently with Russell about her new project.\\nCNN: How did the idea come about ?\\nCameron Russell: I had been thinking about an online participatory magazine for a while. After the amazing response to my TEDx talk, my Brooklyn-based art lab decided it was time to make this a reality. At the Big Bad Lab, we build participatory art and media platforms for causes, communities and organizations we care about. I run the magazine with Hannah Assebe and Allison Bland as well as hundreds of collaborators who provide writing, photos, editing help and moral support.\\nCNN: Why Interrupt ?\\nRussell: Statistics show that diversity in the media is pretty dismal. Critical voices from women and people of color are missing from many important conversations. Ever watch a panel about immigration without any immigrants ? Abortion without any women ? Marriage rights without any LGBTQ people ? We knew it's crazy to start another media platform, but we came across many authentic voices online and offline that we felt we can bring together and showcase. Sometimes you just need to interrupt !\\nCNN: What are highlights in the first issue ?\\nRussell: It's all about body image. We found out that about 50 % of 8-year-old girls do n't like their bodies. But it's not just girls. Many women said they could n't remember a time when they liked their bodies -- they could n't remember what that felt like.\\nWe collaborated with Interrupt photographer Marie C. who interviewed girls under the age of 8 asking what they liked about their bodies. Their answers illuminated a perspective that was missing from mass-media conversations. These girls liked their bodies because they functioned well ! Instead of the usual negative views -- I 'm too fat or I do n't like my nose -- these girls appreciated the fact that they can draw with their hands and run fast with their legs. It's refreshing. Their story was a huge success and got over 5,000 shares.\\nThen there's Teagan Widmer, a transgender woman who wrote about trying to find the right bra. Her story is not exactly something the mainstream press would cover. But when we posted her advice to our Tumblr site it became one of the most popular stories.\\nThe lesson here is that when we value a narrow range of experiences and perspectives, we do n't just have a media that lack diversity, we actually underestimate our audiences. There are n't just a few types of experiences that matter -- there are countless.\\nCNN: With so many publications going digital only, what made you decide to put out a magazine ?\\nRussell: Our first print issue is a mock tabloid. Starting this week, it is appearing for free in nail salons, newsstands, dentist offices and other not-so-hidden places around NYC. Improving access to media means not just focusing on early adopters. We are spending our resources on building a community of collaborators who can share unique and critical views.\\nCNN: What's been the most interesting experience in launching Interrupt ?\\nRussell: Actually, I think working on the offline Genius Lab. We wanted to build a space where people felt comfortable and genius in their identity. We have two selfie walls because taking a selfie is an innate and obvious way that draws in a lot of young people. We have a You Are a Geniusbar, where people can explore online resources for social services, civic engagement, health and well-being, and creative production.\\nHaving a physical offline space where children, teenagers and random passers-by can come in and get involved is amazing. Check them out on our Tumblr feed. Many of these people spent over an hour here, took pictures, wrote pieces for the next issue and hung out. Sometimes, great collaboration is hard to nurture online so doing so offline is the way to go. We hope to run another one this fall. Stay tuned.\\nCNN: How do you get the word out ?\\nRussell: The first several hundred submissions came from people who found out about the project online, mostly through Twitter. Now that we 're deeper into the project, we 've cultivated many more collaborations. For example, -LRB- check out -RRB- a cool piece we did with teens at South End Technology Center in Boston. We 've found artists like Ernest English, who made a piece that is drawing the most attention in the Genius Lab.\\nCNN: What's the biggest difference between your webzine and say Buzzfeed ?\\nRussell: There are a ton of new media startups heavily focused on getting huge traffic and high growth, but that's not our central goal. We want to build something that disrupts the way we think media can be made.\\nCan Interrupt make an impact ?\\nRussell: Every time someone who is n't a media maker creates something that goes viral, every time someone whose perspective is left out of mainstream media proves to make an impact, every time a contributor collaborates with someone new to make better work, we improve the media landscape a little bit.\\nCNN: What did you want to be when you grow up ?\\nRussell: I always wanted to become president ! When I was a kid, I was obsessed with politics. The first long book I remember reading was -LRB- Richard -RRB- Neustadt's Presidential Power in fourth grade. But as I learned more about our democracy, I realized that who participates, who votes and who gets elected is not as simple as it seems. That got me interested in how to bring people together and ignite alternative networks of power, and that's why I started the Big Bad Lab.\\nCNN: Who are your heroes ?\\nRussell: I 'm inspired by the people I work with. At the Genius Lab, we have three incredible artists. Ernest English makes enormous participatory public art pieces. Adalky Capellan is a young woman who creates very large-scale work. When I saw her photos, I knew she was perfect to do our dream selfie wall background. And then there's the graffiti artist and muralist known as miss163. She is a joy to work with, and her piece is all about love, which is great for us since one of our upcoming issues is about LGBT.\\nCNN: If you can give one piece of advice to young women, what would it be ?\\nRussell: When boys at school told me I could n't play their game, my mom told me to ask: Why, do you need a penis to play ? \\n\",\"summary\":\"Cameron Russell launches Interrupt magazine to bring diverse voices into the media conversation, starting with a focus on body image.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of Cameron Russell surrounded by a diverse group of people sharing their stories, with a backdrop of vibrant artwork and uplifting messages.\"}"}]}

Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste.\\nThe semipro football player for the Boston Bandits was 27.\\nDays after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. Testimony in the case against Hernandez began in January.\\nOn Wednesday, a Fall River, Massachusetts, jury -- after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found the former New England patriots tight end guilty of first-degree murder, which carries a penalty of life without parole, as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition.\\nHernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. He has pleaded not guilty.\\nJust two years ago, he was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the New England Patriots.\\nFriends and fans alike wondered: How could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder ?\\nLong before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty.\\n I do n't think there was another family that was more familiar in Bristol, Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for the Bristol Press, told CNN.\\nThe young Hernandez was the golden boy, playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community.\\nHernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends.\\n I saw a closeness with them that I 'd never seen before, Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father.\\nBut his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored, died from complications after a routine surgery.\\nHernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators, and trouble seemed to follow.\\nIn just his first semester, a police report says, Hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum.\\nThe following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. Police reports linked Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot.\\nHernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel.\\nAt the time, Hernandez's mother told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, I know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting. \\nThe case remains open, and no one has been charged.\\nHernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year.\\nTrying to put the alleged drug use behind him, Hernandez wrote a letter to the Patriots director of personnel.\\n If you draft me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season.... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test, he wrote, according to the Boston Globe.\\nBefore the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first - or second-round pick. He was passed over until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him.\\nBy the end of his second season, he was a bona fide star, landing the $40 million contract extension.\\nLess than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with Lloyd's murder.\\nWhen Odin Lloyd pulled up in a black Chevrolet suburban, Boston Bandits coach Mike Branch thought something was out of place. Lloyd did n't own a car.\\nAaron Hernandez case: Who's who ?\\nBranch had his suspicions, but he could n't get answers. Lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night.\\n He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money, Branch recalled. Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night.\\nLloyd's friends say he was n't a big partier. He was more passionate about football and family.\\nRemembering Odin Lloyd\\nLloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the all-American who made it. Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna, who's engaged to Hernandez and is the mother of his little girl.\\nOn June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the black Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez.\\nDaryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. As they parted ways, Lloyd told Hodge he 'd see him later.\\nThe next day, Lloyd's body was found.\\nProsecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima.\\nSurveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m..\\nAt the same time, chilling text messages from Lloyd's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with Nfl, adding, just so u know. \\nBetween 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29, a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez's driveway, about a half a mile from the death scene.\\nThree people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them.\\nNine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges. He pleaded not guilty.\\nIn April 2014, Ortiz and Wallace were also charged in Lloyd's slaying. They, too, pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture, a legal term that means it's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in Lloyd's murder.\\nAs the trial for the death of Lloyd neared, lawyers began arguing about evidence, including cell phones and text messages. Some rulings were victories for the defense.\\nThe jury would n't see the text Lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with Nfl. The judge ruled it hearsay and said the state had n't proven Lloyd believed his life was in danger.\\nJurors also did n't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been. The judge agreed with defense lawyers that it's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to Lloyd's murder.\\nInvestigators allege Hernandez shot and killed Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink.\\nDistrict Attorney Patrick Haggan described the scene in a Massachusetts courtroom in May, saying Hernandez became angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after Mr. Abreu smiled and did not apologize. \\nProsecutors: Bump, spilled drink led to double homicide\\nHernandez's friend tried to calm him down, and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. Court documents identify that friend as Alexander Bradley, who would go on to accuse Hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later.\\nAfter leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said.\\nHernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said.\\nHe then pulled up to the victimscar at a red light and leaned out the driver's side window with a loaded revolver, Haggan told the court.\\nHernandez allegedly said, Yo, what's up now, followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a.38 - caliber revolver, Haggan said.\\nAbreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest. Furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Haggan said.\\nHernandez was charged in the double homicide in May, and he pleaded not guilty.\\nInvestigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of Lloyd.\\nCNN's Laura Dolan, Kristi Ramsay and Michelle Rozsa contributed to this report.\\n\",\"summary\":\"A detailed account of the rise and fall of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, from his promising football career to his involvement in multiple murder cases, culminating in a life sentence without parole for first-degree murder.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of a football field with a dark shadow overlay symbolizing the downfall of a sports star.\"}"}]}

But for hundreds of children in the rural villages of Colombia, Luis Soriano is far from a clown. He is a man with a mission to save rural children from illiteracy.\\n There was a time when many people thought that I was going crazy, said Soriano, a native of La Gloria, Colombia. They 'd yell, Carnival season is over.... Now I 've overcome that. \\nSoriano, 38, is a primary school teacher who spends his free time operating a biblioburro, a mobile library on donkeys that offers reading education for hundreds of children living in what he describes as abandoned regions in the Colombian state of Magdalena.\\n In -LSB- rural -RSB- regions, a child must walk or ride a donkey for up to 40 minutes to reach the closest schools, Soriano said. The children have very few opportunities to go to secondary school.... There are -LSB- few -RSB- teachers that would like to teach in the countryside. \\nDo you know a hero ? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes\\nAt the start of his 17-year teaching career, Soriano realized that some students were having difficulty not just learning, but finishing their homework assignments. Most of the students falling behind lived in rural villages, where illiterate parents and lack of access to books prevented them from completing their studies.\\nTo help bridge the learning gap, Soriano decided to personally bring books to the children.\\n I saw two unemployed donkeys at home and had the idea -LSB- to use -RSB- them in my biblioburro project because they can carry a heavy load, Soriano said. I put the books on their backs in saddles and they became my work tools. \\nEvery Wednesday at dusk and every Saturday at dawn, Soriano leaves his wife and three young children to travel to select villages -- up to four hours each way -- aboard a donkey named Alfa. A second donkey, Beto, follows behind, toting additional books and a sitting blanket. They visit 15 villages on a rotating basis.\\n It's not easy to travel through the valleys, Soriano said. You sit on a donkey for five or eight hours, you get very tired. It's a satisfaction to arrive to your destination. \\nAt each village, some 40-50 youngsters await their chance to get homework help, learn to read or listen to any variety of tall tales, adventure stories and geography lessons Soriano has prepared.\\n You can just see that the kids are excited when they see the biblioburro coming this way. It makes them happy that he continues to come, said Dairo Holguin, 34, whose two children take part in the program. For us, his program complements what the children learn in school. The books they do not have access to... they get from the biblioburro. \\nMore than 4,000 youngsters have benefited from Soriano's program since it began in 1990. Soriano says countless others have been helped, too; parents and other adult learners often participate in the lessons.\\nSoriano has spent nearly 4,000 hours riding his donkeys, and he's not traveled unscathed. In July 2008, he fractured his leg when he fell from one of the donkeys; in 2006, he was pounced on by bandits at a river crossing and tied to a tree when they found out he had no money. Despite these injuries, which left him with a limp, Soriano has no intention of slowing down.\\nIn addition to the biblioburro program, he and his wife built the largest free library in Magdalena next to their home. The library has 4,200 books, most of which are donated -- some from as far away as New York City. They also run a small community restaurant.\\nSoriano's hope is that people will understand the power of reading and that communities can improve from being exposed to books and diverse ideas.\\n For us teachers, it's an educational triumph, and for the parents -LSB- it's -RSB- a great satisfaction when a child learns how to read. That's how a community changes and the child becomes a good citizen and a useful person, Soriano said. Literature is how we connect them with the world. \\nWant to get involved ?

So this week I 'm empowering people with information about swine flu: how to protect yourself, what all the numbers mean and why you should n't freak out.\\nThe most recnt advice from the CDC is that non-essential travel to Mexico should be avoided.\\n1. Has n't swine flu been around for a while ?\\nYes. Swine flu was first identified in 1930 when researchers isolated the virus in a pig. In 1976, more than 200 soldiers at Fort Dix, New Jersey, got swine flu. From 1976 until 2005, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received approximately one report every year or two of humans with swine flu. From December 2005 until January 2009, there were 12 cases of swine flu reported.\\n2. The folks who have it now, did they get it from pigs or people ?\\nIt appears that no one in the United States with swine flu had any contact with pigs. Dr. Richard Besser, the acting director of the CDC, said in a news conference Friday that among the first seven cases, no one had contact with pigs. In another press conference Monday, he added that investigators have looked to see whether any of the infected people had contact with pigs, and we 're not finding that linkage here. \\n3. Swine flu is transmitted from animals to humans. Does that happen a lot ?\\nYes. More than 200 zoonotic diseases are transmitted from animals to humans, including illnesses caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites. Rabies and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -LRB- better known as mad cow disease -RRB- are two well-known examples.\\n4. Should I cancel my trip to Mexico ?\\nYes, you should, unless it's essential. That's the advice from a recent CDC travel warning. Watch Elizabeth Cohen answer your questions \\n5. Should I be freaking out ?\\nA new virus spreading quickly around the world. Young, healthy people struck dead in Mexico. Should we all be panicking ?\\n Absolutely not, said Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Swine flu, he said, is not spreading all that rapidly. Take the St. Francis School in New York. There's been very little transmission from the schoolchildren to family members, and it certainly has n't spread throughout Queens. iReport.com: Share your thoughts, concerns about swine flu\\nBut, Schaffner added, this does n't mean we should n't pay attention to swine flu. We should be alert, keep up with the information coming out daily, and take control by being attentive to your hygiene. Wash your hands very, very frequently and avoid people who are coughing and sneezing. \\n6. How close do you have to be to a sick person to get swine flu ?\\n You can acquire this infection if you 're within the breathing zoneof a sick person, which is about three to six feet, Schaffner said. And we usually mean being this close to someone in a confined space. We 're not talking about fleeting contact. We 're not talking about walking past someone in the street. You need sustained contact. If you think you might have sustained contact with someone who's ill, read this guidance from the CDC's Web site.\\n7. Yikes ! Every day I 'm that close to countless people -- at work, on the bus, at church, in a movie theater. Could I get swine flu from them ?\\nYes.\\n If you 're standing next to someone on a bus, or sitting next to someone or in front of someone in a theater, you could acquire the infection in that fashion, Schaffner said. That's why people with the symptoms of any kind of flu -- fever, diarrhea, body aches, vomiting, etc. -- are urged to stay home and away from groups of people.\\n8. Was n't there a vaccine at one time ? Is there one now ?\\nYes, a swine flu vaccine was given to 45 million people in 1976. There is no vaccine now, although researchers are working on one.\\nThe 1976 vaccine would n't be helpful anyway, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy & Infectious Diseases.\\n That was a completely different virus than the virus we are dealing with right now, completely different in the sense that the genes are different, and it does n't have any relationship, said Fauci. The designation of each one was called the swine flu, but from a viral standpoint and spreading it is quite, quite different. \\nHere are two scientific articles about the swine flu outbreak and vaccination program in 1976:\\n• Reflections on the 1976 Swine Flu Vaccination Program\\n• Swine Influenza A Outbreak, Fort Dix, New Jersey, 1976\\n9. Many young, healthy people have become sick in the United States. Many of the dead in Mexico have been young and healthy. What's going on ? Usually we think of flu as affecting the very young and the very old.\\nThis sometimes happens with new viruses. For example, in 1918 when a new flu virus emerged, many of those stricken were young and healthy. One theory is that young people, who have strong immune systems, mount a particularly vigorous response to new viruses. But there's a potential side effect to the response: the body releases dangerous levels of signaling proteins, called cytokines, which can damage the lungs. Scientists believe these cytokine storms can be fatal.\\nHere is a scientific article about the proposed mechanism of cytokine storms.\\n10. Why are large numbers of people dying in Mexico, but not in other countries ?\\nThis is the big mystery doctors are trying to solve right now. Many infectious disease experts say it's most likely a matter of numbers: with more illnesses in Mexico, there are also more deaths. Other explanations: that in Mexico people have, in addition to swine flu, other viruses that make for a more deadly combination than swine flu alone. It's also possible that the virus infecting the rest of the world is a weaker version than the one in Mexico. Among the swine flu mysteries: Why only deaths in Mexico ?\\n11. Could this new swine flu virus have been manufactured by bioterrorists ?\\nThat's the theory on some conspiracy theoristsWeb sites. But experts do n't believe it.\\n If you were a bioterrorist you 'd want to create something that's a lot more deadly than this, said Dr. Gerald Evans, an associate professor of microbiology at Queen's University in Canada. The problem with influenza is that the second you put it into people, it replicates and mutates very quickly. Even if you created the perfect bioweapon, within a few generations of transmissions, it would n't do what you planned for it to do. \\n12. I get a flu shot every fall. Will that help protect me against swine flu ?\\n The short answer is that the CDC says it's very unlikely, Schaffner said. But he said it might be possible. I think it's a bit of an open question whether repeated flu shots over years would provide a measure of protection. \\n13. I was in Mexico two weeks ago. Could I have contracted swine flu, and the symptoms just have n't shown up yet ?\\nNo. The incubation period of the swine flu is one to seven days.\\n If you just traveled to Mexico and you 're home and feeling well you should get on with your daily life and not worry about it, Evans said.\\n14. Can the swine flu virus live on inanimate objects ? If someone with swine flu touches a doorknob, then I touch it, could I get swine flu ?\\nFlu viruses can live on inanimate surfaces. So theoretically, you could get swine flu from touching a doorknob that was just touched by an infected person. However, that's pretty unlikely, according to Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of epidemiology in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley.\\n I personally would not have a major fear of environmental contamination, he said. Virtually all influenza is transmitted from sneezing and coughing. \\nSchaffner agrees, adding that flu viruses do n't survive in large numbers on surfaces. A doorknob is n't a warm, nourishing environment for a virus, he said.\\n15. What should I do if I develop symptoms of swine flu ?\\nCall your doctor -- do n't just drive on over, Schaffner advised. Follow the instructions of your doctor. He might not want you in the waiting room spreading germs to others, he said.\\nCNN Medical Producer John Bonifield contributed to this report.\\n\",\"summary\":\"An informative guide on swine flu, covering its origins, transmission, prevention, and debunking common myths surrounding the outbreak.\",\"image_description\":\"An illustration showing the transmission of a virus from animals to humans, with emphasis on hygiene practices like handwashing and avoiding close contact with sick individuals.\"}"}]}

Always. If the color is right, I feel better, he touts on his Web site.\\nBut Mizrahi has an explanation for his less than colorful attire on a recent visit to CNN Center in Atlanta.\\n We have this very quick trip, and we have to go right back and there's no time to pack and we ca n't check luggage... so I focused it to black, gray and white. \\nIt's just one more style tip you can pick up from Mizrahi's new book How to Have Style -LRB- Gotham -RRB-. Despite the slightly audacious title, Mizrahi, who has won four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, has earned the right to tell women how to dress.\\nFor five years, the New York fashion designer has been selling low-priced clothing and home furnishings at Target. But with his new book comes a new job -- as the creative director of Liz Claiborne.\\nCNN talked to Mizrahi about his love for theater, the most common fashion mistakes and why bad flowers are never OK. The following is an edited version of that interview:\\nCNN: You started in acting at the High School of the Performing Arts. How do you combine that love and your love for design ?\\nIsaac Mizrahi: Well, you know what, I think it's all theater. I think that fashion is a form of entertainment. And I think that these days, as a fashion designer, it's almost like you represent a political party or something.\\nLike women say, Oh, that's a brand name I associate with because I 've worn it before. I love it. It seems to fulfill who I am really easily. Whatever it is, she knows that it just makes her life really easy so she associates with it, you know ? And in the end, I am like this personality that represents that. Watch Mizrahi talk about his new book \\nBut more than that, I have designs -LSB- in -RSB- the entertainment business. There's a movie called Unzipped about me that was a really successful movie. I had two TV series. I design costumes constantly for theater and ballet and opera. So to me it's all one big world. It's seamless to me.\\nCNN: What's your daily schedule like ? It has to be crazy with all that you do.\\nMizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that. There's a base to it. I wake up, I go swimming every day, and I eat the same breakfast almost every single day. But when I get to work is when it changes up.\\nSome days I work in the showroom; some days I work in the design room; some days I actually work in my own private studio, where I just do sketches and sketches and sketches. Other days I work in the TV studio taping segments and my Web show.\\nI do n't really love travel. I feel like it really disrupts what I love doing most, which is this creation, you know what I mean ? When I finally let myself enjoy it, I can enjoy traveling. But it takes a great agony for me to separate from New York City and my studios and the people that I work with.\\nCNN: Say you 're walking down the street. What's the most common style error that you see in people ?\\nMizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair. I would say that's the most common style error I see is bad hair.\\nYou know people have excuses for bad shoes -- because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they 're walking and walking and walking -- but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair. Because you know what ? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day.\\nBut I always think that women should be encouraged to spend a lot of money on their hair. It's like you should spend your most money... on your hair. You 'd think I had a chain of hair salons, but I do n't. -LSB- Laughter -RSB-.\\nCNN: What about in home furnishing ? You do a line for Target that's ending this year. What's the most common mistake people make there ?\\nMizrahi: You know what it is with people ? I think people get lazy when it comes to being at home -- they leave things around. I like to think about cabinets. I like to put things away as much as possible. It's like salt shakers on the table ? No. You put the salt shakers in a cabinet, and the table looks so much better when it's plain. You know what I mean ?\\nAnd people just think that bad flowers are better than nothing, but I disagree with that. I think that nothing is way better than bad flowers. You either have gorgeous, gorgeous flowers, or you have no flowers. Like at a dinner party, I prefer no flowers usually to the flowers that people have on the table. That's awful, but it's true.\\nCNN: How has your personal style evolved over time ?\\nMizrahi: It's gotten a lot quieter, my personal style. I used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I do n't know, I dress in a very particular way now and it's almost like clockwork. And every once in a while I break out and do something crazy.\\nCNN: Can you describe your personality for me, and how it affects your style ?\\nMizrahi: I do n't know. It's very hard to describe one's personality. I ca n't say about my personality, but I like to think that I 'm very exposed to what's going on out there in the world culturally, and that's what influences my design.\\nIt's kind of like here's the 360 degrees of what's going on -LSB- in -RSB- the world culturally, you know ?

Future captain Viv Richards called it blood money. \\nBut other players were tempted.\\nThe offers from South Africa were more than they would likely see in their lifetimes -- estimated to be between $100,000 and $150,000 per player.\\nIt was enough to draw in names like batsmen Lawrence Rowe and Alvin Kallicharran, fast bowler Sylvester Clarke and wicketkeeper David Murray -- one of the best in the game.\\nAlso agreeing to take part was Collis King, hero of the 1979 World Cup.\\n I made the decision because I was n't getting treated right as far as the West Indies -LRB- team -RRB- was concerned, said King. And I said to myself, Well, cricket is my job. You 're not picking me, I 'll go play cricket someplace where people will see proper cricket.And that's why I went. \\nMore than just cricket\\nRising star Stephenson was only 23 in 1983, with a promising career in front of him. He had repeatedly turned down offers to play in South Africa.\\nBut the day the team left, Stephenson had a change of heart.\\n I knew the tour was more important than being just cricket, Stephenson said. I believe that cricket can make a difference, and I 'm going to be a part of that team. \\nOn the plane, Stephenson recalled, some of the players began having second thoughts. But it was too late -- they were on their way to South Africa, to face apartheid head on.\\n When we got to South Africa, I realized that separation, and it was n't only black and white, he said. It's the language that you speak, the area that you live in, and it's what you 're allowed to do, and where you can go. So the divisions were very real when we got there. \\nUnsure of how they 'd be received by the country's mainly white fanbase, the West Indies rebels prepared for their first Test match.\\nBut their worries soon proved unfounded -- in droves, crowds came out to see the famous cricketers.\\n We packed them in, said Murray. We turned out 20,000 in Pretoria, the heart of apartheid. \\nAs the tour went on, the players began to believe something more important than just cricket was taking place.\\nYoung kids -- white kids -- were begging them for autographs. It seemed South African fans could n't get enough of the black cricketers from the West Indies.\\n For the first time, they were seeing blacks beating whites, said newspaper writer Al Gilkes, the only journalist from the Caribbean to go to South Africa.\\n Here was a country in which no black man had ever seen a black person in competition with a white person, and beating them. To me, that was where the real victory was. \\n` Destroyed as cricketers '\\nBut critics of the tour disagree. They say the presence of a team of black men in South Africa did not help end apartheid, but instead strengthened and supported it.\\nEven within the country itself, non-whites protested the West Indies rebels.\\nBack home in the Caribbean, the reaction was worse. A deep sense of betrayal cut through the Caribbean. Cricketers who were once viewed as heroes were now seen as sellouts.\\nWhen the month-long tour was over, the rebel players knew they would have to face the repercussions of their decision back home.\\n I felt sorry for them, said Gilkes, because I knew that they would never outlive what they were returning to. \\nThe fate of their cricketing careers rested with the West Indies Cricket Board of Control.\\nThe players were aware they might face a ban -- after all, England's rebel team had been banned for three years; Sri Lanka's was banned for 25 years.\\nBut they did not expect to be banned for life.\\n Many of them were destroyed as cricketers, said University of West Indies Professor Hilary Beckles. Their cricket careers came to an end. \\nMurray, once a star, is now drifting, unable to hold a job in Barbados. In the years after the tour, he eventually lost more than just his career.\\nHis wife gave birth to their baby daughter in Australia, while Murray was playing in South Africa.\\nThey faced being deported from Australia for his role in the rebel tours, and were unwelcome back in the Caribbean, too. They had a newborn, and nowhere to go.\\n They did n't want me to return, Murray said. Politics got into it. \\nWhen asked if his current situation resulted from his decision to go, Murray answered: Most likely. \\nMercenaries ?\\nFor Stephenson, the once-rising star, his cricketing past is behind him. He is now a golf instructor at a country club in Barbados.\\nBut he still finds a way to connect to the sport he loved at the cricket and golf academy he started near his home.\\nThere, a photo of his rebel team sits proudly on the shelf. It is not the memories of the tour he wants to forget, but what came after.\\n Nobody looked out for us, Stephenson said.\\nFor the players, their lives defined by this single moment in sport history, each day is a reminder of what they lost by going to South Africa.\\nBut they gained something, too -- strong bonds forged on a tour condemned by the rest of their world, cherished by the participants.\\nAnd to this day, they hold strongly to the belief that being in South Africa in 1983 made a difference in disbanding apartheid, less than a decade after the West Indies players were there.\\nGilkes wrote a seven-part series about the tour. In the last article, he stated the trip might have started with the players being viewed as mercenaries, but he saw them as missionaries who converted white South Africans to accepting that blacks were their equals. \\n I know I went there as a missionary, King said.\\nMurray agreed. I do n't see the mercenary part of it or whatever. We were just professional cricketers. You 've got work to do. \\n What do mercenaries do ? Stephenson asked. They go and fight somebody else's cause.\\n Well, yes I was a mercenary for black people's cause, because wherever I 've been, I 've been an ambassador for my country, my race and the game of cricket. So if that's being a mercenary, then yes I was. \\n\",\"summary\":\"The story delves into the 1983 West Indies cricket tour to apartheid South Africa and its repercussions, revealing the complex decisions and consequences faced by the players involved.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of a cricket match at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados, with a diverse crowd cheering in the stands under the night sky.\"}"}]}

Almost 30 years later, Etan Patz is still missing.\\nEtan Patz, who disappeared in 1979, was the first missing child featured in the milk carton campaigns of the 1980s.\\nEtan was 6 when he disappeared on May 25, 1979, the Friday before Memorial Day. He was on his way to school in what is now the upscale Soho neighborhood of New York.\\nIt was the first time he 'd walked to the bus stop by himself. It was just a few blocks away. Etan, like any 6-year-old, argued that all of his friends walked to the bus stop alone, and his parents relented.\\nHis mother, Julie Patz, learned that Etan had n't been in classes when he failed to return home. She called the school at 3:30 p.m., then called the homes of all his friends. When no one had seen Etan, she called police and filed a missing person's report.\\nBy evening more than 100 police officers and searchers had gathered with bloodhounds. The search continued for weeks, but no clues to Etan's whereabouts were found. Watch an update on the case \\nThe boy's disappearance was one of the key events that inspired the missing children's movement, which raised awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children. Etan's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s.\\n In our minds there were only two possibilities, said Stan Patz, the boy's father. Either Etan was taken by a stranger and killed or he was taken by a very sad woman desperate for a child of her own, and we hoped that such a woman would at least take care of him and keep him safe. \\nPatz lived with this hope until 1982, when he learned of Jose Antonio Ramosarrest and the surprising connection between him and a former babysitter of Etan's.\\nRamos was a drifter who in 1979 lived in Alphabet City, a neighborhood not far from Soho. In 1982 he was arrested after boys in a neighborhood in the Bronx complained that he had stolen their book bags while trying to coax them into a drainpipe under a bridge, where he lived, said the Patzes and federal prosecutor Stuart GraBois, who spent years investigating the case.\\nWhen police found Ramos in his drainpipe home, they found he had many photographs of small blond boys. They noticed that they looked a lot like Etan Patz, according to author Lisa R Cohen's book about the case, After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive. \\nBronx police questioned Ramos, and he denied having anything to do with Etan's disappearance. But he did tell police that his girlfriend used to baby-sit for the boy, GraBois said.\\nProsecutors in the Bronx and Manhattan pursued this lead, but concluded they did not have enough evidence to connect Ramos to Etan's disappearance, GraBois and a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said.\\nRamos was released when the parents of the Bronx boys chose not to press charges against him, according to published reports. He left town and disappeared for six years -- until GraBois reviewed Etan's case. GraBois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect.\\nGraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had been arrested and convicted of child molestation and was serving time in a Pennsylvania prison.\\nGraBois said he brought Ramos to New York for questioning and surprised him with the question: How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz ? \\nRamos told GraBois that he 'd taken a little boy to an apartment he had on the lower East Side on the same day that Etan went missing. He was 90 percent sure it was the same he 'd seen in the news that was missing, GraBois said.\\nAccording to GraBois, Ramos claimed he released the boy and brought him to a subway station so the boy could go visit his aunt in Washington Heights.\\n Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights, GraBois said. When questioned further, Ramos refused to say anything more and asked for a lawyer, according to GraBois.\\nRamos is serving a 10 - to 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania. He is scheduled to be released in November 2012, GraBois said.\\nGraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison, and planted informants as his cell mates. He would n't go into detail about what Ramos might have told them, but said he's convinced he's eyeing the right suspect.\\nGraBois turned over his evidence to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, but prosecutors have not brought charges. They say that without a body, they do n't have enough evidence.\\nEtan's case is still considered by the NYPD to be a cold case.\\nAnyone with information on the whereabouts of Etan Patz or that leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for his disappearance is asked to call the FBI/NYPD Etan Patz hotline: 212-384-2200.\\n\",\"summary\":\"The case of Etan Patz, the first missing child featured in milk carton campaigns, remains unsolved almost 30 years later, shedding light on the missing children's movement and the challenges of investigating cold cases.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of a milk carton with a missing child's photo alongside a headline about the disappearance of Etan Patz.\"}"}]}

That's why March 14 -- 3-14 -- is Pi Day. What's more, Albert Einstein was born on this day.\\nA quick refresher: Pi is defined as the distance around a perfect circle, or the circumference, divided by the distance across it, or the diameter. It is also involved in calculating the area of a circle, the volume of a sphere, and many other mathematical formulas you might need in the sciences.\\nThroughout history, people have been captivated by this number because there is no way to calculate it exactly by a simple division on your calculator. What's more, its digits go on infinitely, without any pattern in the numbers. 3.1415926535897932... etc.. Even that many digits are more than most people would need for everyday use, but some folks have been inspired to memorize thousands of digits of pi, or even use the digits to create poetry or music.\\nOn Pi Day, one number reeks of mystery '\\nMath may be scary, but pi is not -- as evidenced by the widespread revelry on Pi Day. One might even say -- gasp ! -- it's cool to like pi these days. Even the House of Representatives supported the designation of March 14 as National Pi Day in 2009.\\nIn countries where the day is written before the month, Friday is 14-3, which looks less like pi. And so Pi Day is an acquired taste, mathematician Jonathan Borwein, at the University of Newcastle in Australia, said in an e-mail.\\nConveniently, pi sounds like pie, and pies are round. You could celebrate Pi Day in a casual way by grabbing a slice of pastry, or pizza. If you 're in enrolled in school, your math class or math department might be doing something special already.\\nBut if you happen to live in a particularly pi-happy place, you might be able to take part in some larger-scale, pi-inspired activities.\\nWhere Pi Day began\\nIf you want to go where the day is said to be invented, look no further than San Francisco's Exploratorium. Larry Shaw, who worked in the electronics group at the museum, began the tradition in 1988. Last year was Pi Day's 25th anniversary there.\\nPi Day began as a small gathering with mostly museum staff. Now it's a public pi extravaganza featuring a Pi procession, whose attendees get a number -- 0 to 9 -- and line up in the order of pi's digits: 3.14159265... you get the idea.\\nThe parade ends at the pi shrine -- a pi symbol with digits spiraling around it embedded in the sidewalk, which was unveiled last year.\\nFor those who ca n't attend in person, the Exploratorium has a Second Life Pi Day event that includes irrational exhibits, fireworks, cheerleaders, music, and dancing. The museum also lists a bunch of educational activities to teach about the concept of pi.\\nOn Pi Day, is piunder attack ?\\nWhere Einstein lived\\nOn the opposite coast, the leafy university town where Albert Einstein spent the last 22 years of his life is showing community-wide exuberance for pi.\\nPrinceton, New Jersey, kicks off Pi Day weekend on Thursday night with a reading by physicist Charles Adler, then heads into a full day of activities on Friday, including a walking tour of Einstein's neighborhood and a pizza pie-making contest.\\nThe pie-eating contest takes place at McCaffrey's supermarket, while an Einstein look-alike competition will match mustaches and wild gray hair at the Princeton Public Library.\\nPi fans who have been spending the last year memorizing digits can show off and compete at the library, where the winner among 7 - to 13-year-olds can take home a cool pi-hundred -LRB- That is, $314.15 -RRB-. The Historical Society of Princeton will have an Einstein birthday party. Tetsuya Miyamoto, inventor of the KENKEN puzzle, will speak at the library as well.\\nHere are 10,000 digits of pi for you to memorize\\nThe brainiac town residents love this event because it's a way for them to celebrate how quirky they are, said Mimi Omiecinski, owner of the Princeton Tour Company, who started Princeton Pi Day in 2009. A lot of them get super into it. Last year about 9,000 people participated, she said.\\nAlong with her fascination with Albert Einstein, Omiecinski was inspired to launch a town-wide Pi Day after she heard that the Princeton University mathematics department celebrates March 14 with pie-eating and pi-reciting -LRB- As a Princeton student, I got second place for most digits in 2005 and 2006 -RRB-.\\nEven more pi\\nChicago is getting into the pi business too. Lots of restaurants and bakeries are offering Pi Day specials. The Illinois Science Council and Fleet Feet Sports are hosting a 3.14-mile walk/run Friday night, with discounts for anyone named Albert, Alberta or Albertina. Philly.com highlights two options for satisfying your pie cravings in the City of Brotherly Love.\\nBostonians can head to Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Pi Time -LRB- 3:14 p.m. -RRB- for pi-themed activities such as Throw Pie at Your Best Friend on High-Speed Camera. \\nThe Museum of Science in Boston has educational Pi Day events, and the Seattle Children's Museum will celebrate too.\\nEven the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, will celebrate the day, as Dali loved the irrational numbers Pi and Phi, often using them and other mathematical principles in his art, according to the museum. If you live in the area, check out their schedule of math-inspired films and tours throughout the day.\\nThere are plenty of online resources too, such as piday.org.\\nOutside of the physical classroom, Pi Day will be celebrated online through Google's virtual classroom project. David Blatner, author of the comprehensive book The Joy of Pi, is hosting a Pi Day competition in which students from three classrooms will square off to see who can recite the most digits of pi from memory.\\nHow did Pi Day become such a big thing ?\\nBlatner says that Pi Day has become a hit for the same reason the new Cosmos TV show is getting so much attention.\\n People all around the world are hungry to make science and math fun and interesting, he said in an e-mail. We know math and science is important, we know that it's fascinating, but we often do n't know how to make it fun and interesting. Pi Day gives us a great excuse to throw away our fear of math and say Hey, it IS kind of neat !\\nIf you agree, just wait until 3/14/15 -- or as one popular Facebook group calls it, The Only Pi Day of Our Lives. \\nThat's because pi to four digits after the decimal is 3.1415, and we 're unlikely to survive until 2115 to see that second instance of pi perfection.\\nSo get ready next year to take a picture of your digital clock on 3/14/15 at 9:26:53 a.m. That 'll be worth more than a thousand digits.\\nFollow Elizabeth Landau on Twitter at @lizlandau\\nHow do you celebrate Pi Day ?

His death left her to raise a young child alone. For 16 years, she stayed single because, going through it once was enough for me. \\nWhen she met Dale Benzine, he weighed around 300 pounds but was in pretty good physical shape. Yet over time, she watched as the former football player started taking pills for his high cholesterol and high blood pressure, more for anxiety and gout, and insulin shots for his Type 2 diabetes.\\n His girth got bigger, as did his neck, which caused sleep apnea, she remembers. After the Atlanta couple got married, she found herself buying him bigger and bigger clothes.\\nWhen her insurance company announced that bariatric surgery, or weight-loss surgery, would be covered under the couple's plan, she told her husband about it. I knew he had to do something, but I was n't sure he was ready for something so drastic, she says.\\nHe was.\\nThe doctor had flat-out told Benzine: Lose weight or die. He was tired of taking so many medications and not having enough energy to simply live life.\\n One day... you find out that you 're 56 years old and if you want to see 66 you better do something about it, he says.\\nThere are several types of bariatric surgery. With gastric bypass, a new stomach about the size of a golf ball is created by cutting across the top of the stomach and connecting the smaller pouch with the intestines.\\nAnother type involves placing an adjustable band around the upper portion of the stomach. The device can be tightened or loosened at subsequent doctor's visits. It can help patients feel fuller faster and eat less. Unlike gastric bypass, adjustable gastric band procedures can be easily reversed.\\nBenzine decided to do the gastric bypass surgery. Although doctors are n't sure why, studies have shown gastric bypass puts Type 2 diabetes into remission in most obese patients. Dale also did n't want to have the option of reversing the surgery.\\n In the back of your mind you can always take the band off, he says of the lap-band procedure. I did n't want to be able to go back. \\nGetting approved for the surgery was more difficult than he expected. Many people who have bariatric surgery gain the weight back, so insurance companies are often wary of paying for the procedure. Benzine saw his primary care physician, a nutritionist, a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a gastroenterologist and a psychiatrist -- all of whom had to sign off.\\nThe psychiatrist told Benzine he rejected upward of half his patients because they were n't prepared to make the necessary life changes after the surgery. Benzine admitted that 10 years ago he would n't have been ready either.\\n I 'm from Wisconsin, he says. I enjoyed my beer, brats and cheese too much. But kids and grandkids changes things. He was ready.\\nHe eventually got the go-ahead. The day of his surgery, his wife recalls she was an emotional wreck. I tried to dissuade -LRB- him -RRB- from having it. What if they made a wrong cut ? What if he did n't wake up ? What if he had a heart attack on the table ? \\nThe surgery was a success, but he was far from the ideal patient. Shortly after surgery he ate a popsicle too fast and starting throwing up. When he got home, he continued his trial-and-error period, getting sick as he learned his limits.\\n Imagine after you eat your big Thanksgiving dinner -- times 10, he says of overeating with his smaller stomach. And you ca n't do anything about it. You 're just so miserable and it's either got to come up or go out. \\nHe started out on a liquid diet, then pureed his food. Slowly he introduced solids.\\n We did n't go to happy hour or dinner with friends because he was uncomfortable, Debbie Benzine says. I started hiding out to eat because I felt guilty. \\nIt was like being a baby and learning to eat all over again, Benzine says. He realized that meat -- steak, chicken, turkey -- was too tough for his stomach to handle. But popcorn went down easily. He developed 10 rules for himself, and other bariatric patients, and the weight began to fall off.\\nIn six months, he had lost more than 125 pounds.\\nThe hardest thing for him was filling time. He had to learn to reward himself with activities instead of food. He now smokes a cigar instead of eating a bag of chips, or plans a big weekend getaway to celebrate a work success. He orders an appetizer instead of an entree when he goes out to play cards with friends during the week.\\nHis daily diet routinely consists of Greek yogurt, protein bars, soup, popcorn, cheese and crackers. He does n't eat large meals, just smaller portions whenever he's hungry.\\nIn some ways, his wife has had to alter her lifestyle to fit his. It has n't been easy, the couple says, but it has been worth it.\\n I 'm 57 going on 37, Benzine says with a laugh. No pun intended -- I 'm like a kid in a candy store. He plans to attend his 40th high school reunion in June with pride: I know I 'll be one of the only people who can say they weigh less at that reunion than they did in high school. \\nMore importantly, I will have my husband and best friend around for a long time, his wife says.\\nFollow Dale's '10 Commandmentsof bariatric surgery\\n1 -RRB- Set your goals early, both in pounds to lose and the date by which you want to achieve this loss. Keep a daily log or scorecard of your weight loss.\\n2 -RRB- Trial and error of foods and liquids will be necessary, but painful. Blueberries were terrible for me, but butter-free popcorn worked. Go figure. Hint: Keep your anti-nausea pills close by -- you will definitely need them in the beginning.\\n3 -RRB- Find a high-protein breakfast and lunch that you can live with each day. -LRB- Mine was Greek yogurt for breakfast and smoothies with strawberry, banana and chocolate protein. -RRB- Also, stay true to your vitamin regimen, especially vitamin B12, vitamin D and calcium.\\n4 -RRB- Concentrate on changing your daily eating habits from three large meals per day, plus snacks, to five to six small meals.\\n5 -RRB- Stay hydrated ! It's very important that you avoid getting dehydrated, so avoid intake of caffeine, carbonated sodas, beer and alcohol.\\n6 -RRB- Move more while you are eating less. Start out walking 30 minutes, four to five days a week. Build up to walking farther and faster, and more often, while adding weight lifting two to three days per week. You will be amazed how fast the weight will start dropping once you get into this routine, plus your dog will love it even more than you !\\n7 -RRB- Start rewarding your new body with activities instead of food. Reward yourself by going to see a favorite performer if you hit a weight loss goal. Join a card club, start reading again, or make a movie date with your significant other each week. Replacing your going out to eat time with activities will arguably be the best move you will make during this whole journey.\\n8 -RRB- It's OK to leave food on your plate ! Regardless of what your mother said growing up, children in Africa, India or China are n't going to be affected if you leave food on your plate when eating at home or away. People will ask why, but trust me, you wo n't be hurting their feelings if you just say you 're full.\\n9 -RRB- Order an appetizer as your main meal when eating out. You will be amazed how full you will be after eating the smaller servings and your pocketbook will also thank you.\\n10 -RRB- And last, but definitely not least, welcome and embrace your support network, be it a wife, friend, business colleague, etc.. You will have good days and a few bad ones and the unconditional love and support these people will show you will help you push through the bad and be there to help celebrate the good !\\nHave you lost weight ?

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\\nNASA ANNOUNCER: Two... one... booster ignition... and the final liftoff of Discovery.\\nCARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Of course, we will have more on that for you in today's show, but we are getting off the ground in northern Africa. My name is Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now !\\nFirst Up: Unrest in Libya\\nAZUZ: There are roughly 6,000 Americans in Libya, and the U.S. government is trying to get them out. A ferry that was chartered to take hundreds of U.S. citizens from Libya to Malta was held up for a while yesterday. U.S. officials said everyone onboard was safe. They said the delay was because of the weather.\\nMeanwhile, Libya's leader, Moammar Gadhafi, is blaming the violence in his country on young people. He says they 're taking some sort of pills and being manipulated by the al Qaeda terrorist group. But during a speech earlier this week, President Obama said what's going on in that part of the world has nothing to do with outside influences.\\nU.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: So let me be clear. The change that is taking place across the region is being driven by the people of the region. This change does n't represent the work of the United States or any foreign power. It represents the aspirations of people who are seeking a better life.\\nPolitical Unrest\\nAZUZ: Looking around that region, starting next door to Libya in Algeria. The country has lifted a 19-year-old state of emergency, and what that means is that people there have greater freedom of speech and assembly now. Moving south to Cameroon, where protesters are demanding that the country's president step down. He's been in power for nearly 30 years and is running for re-election this year. Finally, Yemen, where eight lawmakers resigned to protest violence against people who are demonstrating against the government. One of the lawmakers said, I resigned because there's been no respect by the government for human rights. \\nIs This Legit ?\\nJOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit ? The space shuttle Discovery is named after sailing ships. This one's true ! The shuttle is named after two ships that explored the world.\\nFinal Mission\\nAZUZ: The space shuttle Discovery has made more trips into space than any other craft. All together, the shuttle's spent almost a full year in orbit around the Earth. Yesterday, Discovery set out on its 39th and last mission, delivering equipment to the international space station. This was Discovery's first launch, back in 1984. And these launches are n't cheap. NASA estimates that every time a shuttle takes off, it costs nearly half a billion dollars. After Discovery's current mission, there are just two launches left for the space shuttle program.\\nBudget Battle\\nAZUZ: We 've been reporting on this controversial budget bill in Wisconsin. You can check our transcript archives for details on that. Now, it was scheduled to come up for a vote yesterday, but only in the State House of Representatives. Things are not moving forward in the Wisconsin Senate. And that's because Democratic senators have left the state in an effort to try to block any vote on the bill. You can get the latest details on this situation at CNN.com.\\nTeachersLounge\\nAZUZ: Our latest TeachersLounge blog asks for your opinions about a controversial budget decision in Detroit. The city's planning to close half of its public schools. And teachers, we want to hear your thoughts on this. Enter the TeachersLounge from our home page: CNNStudentNews.com !\\nShoutout\\nTOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Bozic's world geography class at Cypress Creek High School in Houston, Texas ! Willie O'Ree was the first African-American to play in what sports league ? Was it the: A -RRB- MLB, B -RRB- NBA, C -RRB- NFL or D -RRB- NHL ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! Willie O'Ree made his debut in the National Hockey League in 1958. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout !\\nDiversity in Hockey\\nAZUZ: Willie O'Ree paved the way for other African-Americans to hit the NHL ice. As we continue our commemoration of Black History Month, we 're taking a look at the diversity on the Atlanta Thrashersroster. Richelle Carey sat down with the team's four African-Americans to talk about life as a minority pro hockey player.\\n-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO -RRB-\\nRICHELLE CAREY, HLN ANCHOR: I want each one of you to tell me what you like about hockey. Sell me on hockey ! Sell me !\\nEVANDER KANE, THRASHERS LEFT WINGER: Hockey is the fastest, most physical sport there is.\\nJOHNNY ODUYA, THRASHERS DEFENSEMAN: The teamwork, too. I would say a total package sport.\\nANTHONY STEWART, THRASHERS RIGHT WINGER: I just like skating fast, ever since I was three.\\nDUSTIN BYFUGLIEN, THRASHERS DEFENSEMAN: I guess it's just something about being on the ice that I enjoy. It's just me being out there, having fun and enjoying the people around me.\\nCAREY: What's the biggest misconception or false assumption that people make about you ?\\nBYFUGLIEN: This guy ca n't stand on skates.\\nODUYA: Maybe in Atlanta, you tell people that you 're a hockey player and they do n't believe you.\\nCAREY: What do you think ?\\nODUYA: I do n't know. Maybe basketball or baseball, I have no idea.\\nCAREY: Who here knew that they were going to be a professional hockey player ? Anybody here know that ?\\nSTEWART: I knew probably when I was in grade one. We had an assignment to say what you wanted to be when you grew up. And I said, Hockey player, and she said, Pick something else. And I said, No, I 'm going to be a hockey player, and I stuck with it.\\nCAREY: Did anybody try to steer you to something different, because you do n't look out on the ice that often and see people of color ? Did someone say this is n't the right fit for you ?\\nKANE: No, I think, honestly, it was almost the opposite. My dad really instilled that drive in me to battle through that kind of stuff, battle through adversity, and that's what made me so successful.\\nCAREY: Anybody else feel that they were steered in a different direction for racial reasons at all ?\\nSTEWART: I grew up sort of in an urban neighborhood and, you know, a lot of my friends are playing basketball and sports like that. I 'd go play a little bit of basketball, but after an hour I 'd get bored of it, so I 'd say, I have to go play hockey now. And they would go, Uh, naw, you 're not going to make it in hockey, so you might as well play basketball or something like that. But I had some support from my parents. That helped me a lot. All my close friends to date were minor hockey players, and their support helped get me to where I am today.\\nCAREY: We always hear about hockey as, it's an expensive sport for kids who want to play. And often, maybe, that's why minority kids do n't get into it. Explain, why is it so expensive ?\\nSTEWART: I think when you have to pay $500 for a pair of skates as opposed to a $20 basketball or $50 pair of soccer shoes, it makes a lot more sense to play those sports. But there's a lot of community initiatives right now in the NHL helping urban kids. And with the Hockey Is For Everyone program that's helping not so fortunate kids play, they 're making good strides.\\n-LRB- END VIDEO -RRB-\\nBefore We Go\\nAZUZ: Finally today, with the space shuttle program winding down, we 're looking back at the 132 missions that have come before. And just for fun, we 're gon na do it in 132 seconds. Start the countdown.\\n-LSB- VIDEO PACKAGE OF ALL 132 SHUTTLE LAUNCHES -RSB-\\nGoodbye\\nAZUZ: Seeing all that video can leave you feeling spacy ! Before we launch into the weekend, we thank our fans on Facebook for all of your likes at Facebook.com / CNNStudentNews. And we 're working on a new video for you, so be on the lookout for that next week. Hope you all have a great weekend.

In fact, Baldwin was on the cusp of discovering a new weapon â $ he just did n't realize it.\\nUpon first reading of Baldwin's tirade, you might have missed the solution -LRB- after all, the piece is rather long and, at times, tiresome -RRB-. But the answer is staring us in the face. In fact, it's staring all of us in the face. Every day.\\nThese days, Baldwin said, everyone has a camera in their pocket. Not just the Ron Galellas of the world, but all of the John Q. Publics looking for a chance to shame a celebrity. This kind of world is too much for Baldwin, who is prone to losing his temper.\\nBut if cameras are small, cheap, and ubiquitous, why not use it to your advantage ? Why not take one with you when you go in public, thus ensuring the public can always see your side of the story ? They are baiting you, Baldwin said in his farewell-to-the-world. You can tell they want to get into it with you. Some bump into me or block the entrance to my apartment... Exactly. So why not catch them in the act ?\\nDoes that sound like too much trouble ? Maybe so. But if you 're rich like Baldwin, why not hire someone to follow you around and record life as it happens ? Go about your daily life, but have a trusted and well-paid photographer at your side, documenting just how rude, invasive, and aggressive the celebrity chasers can be.\\nStill sound unreasonable ? There's yet another solution that just made itself available. You can record your daily interactions with a wearable camera embedded in your glasses. If you want to show the world what really happened with that jerk of a photographer, just upload the footage from your Google Glass. As USA Today reported earlier this month, police departments are outfitting their officers with wearable cameras to protect both police and citizens against unfair accusations.\\nAll of this might sound extreme. Why should celebrities have to go to such lengths to protect themselves ? It may be a lot of trouble, but is n't it better than being humiliated repeatedly by out-of-context outbursts ? Is n't it better than retiring from a job you love and living as a hermit for the rest of your life ? Baldwin said in his diatribe, You 're out there in a world where if you do make a mistake, it echoes in a digital canyon forever. True, but not if you can show your side of the story.\\nIt may be too late for Baldwin, but not for other celebrities. Do n't disappear from public life just to spite the paparazzi. If you do, the celebrity gossip sites will win. It's time for a 21st century solution. It's time to fight photos with photos.\\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David R. Wheeler.\\n\",\"summary\":\"A discussion on the challenges celebrities face with intrusive media and a proposed modern solution to combat paparazzi intrusion.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of a celebrity walking in public with a discreet wearable camera embedded in their glasses, capturing interactions with paparazzi.\"}"}]}

This article is meant for readers at the B1 CEFR language proficiency level."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"title\":\"The George Zimmerman Trial: A Case of Controversy and Debate\",\"content\":\"A prosecuting attorney greeted the jury in the George Zimmerman trial Monday with a quote full of expletives, while his adversary decided it was appropriate to tell jurors a knock-knock joke.\\nAnd that was just the beginning of opening statements in Zimmerman's long-anticipated murder trial.\\nIn a case that has ignited national debate about gun laws and race relations, Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, is accused of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February 2012 in Sanford, Florida.\\nProsecutor John Guy's first words to the six-woman jury may have raised a few eyebrows.\\n Good morning. F ***** g punks, these a ****** s all get away, Guy quoted Zimmerman. These were the words in this grown man's mouth as he followed this boy that he did n't know. Those were his words, not mine. \\nZimmerman, Guy said, got out of his car with a pistol and two flashlights to follow Trayvon Benjamin Martin, who was walking home from a 7-Eleven, armed with a fruit drink and a bag of candy. Eventually the two became entangled on the ground in a fight. A witness has said Martin was on top of Zimmerman, Guy said.\\n The defendant claims that while Trayvon Martin was on top of him, he said, you are going to die tonight, said Guy. Nobody heard that. \\nGuy told jurors that no witnesses saw what happened the night of the shooting from beginning to end. Witnesses only saw slices of what happened, he said.\\n We are confident that at the end of this trial you will know in your head, in your heart, in your stomach that George Zimmerman did not shoot Trayvon Martin because he had to, Guy said. He shot him for the worst of all reasons, because he wanted to. \\nFast facts: Trayvon Martin shooting\\nIn the first day of testimony, jurors heard witnesses recount Martin's trip to the convenience store, Zimmerman's call complaining about a suspicious person walking through his neighborhood before Martin's killing, and a call from the previous August, in which Zimmerman reported an alleged burglary to police.\\nProceedings ended for the day when defense attorney Mark O'Mara objected to the earlier call, which prosecutors argued was necessary to explain Zimmerman's remark about burglars who get away. \\nThe Martin family sat watching the proceedings behind State Attorney Angela Corey. Before witness testimony began, Judge Debra Nelson denied a defense request that Martin's father, Tracy Martin, leave the courtroom.\\nTracy Martin is a potential witness, and potential witnesses can be forced to sit outside of the courtroom to keep their testimony from being tainted by other witnesses. But the next-of-kin of victims are allowed to remain in court even if they 're expected to testify.\\nO'Mara also accused Tracy Martin of using an obscenity toward a friend of Zimmerman's while holding the door for him during a hearing two weeks ago. The friend, Timothy Tucholski, testified that he had n't wanted to make an issue of it before.\\n I was n't planning on coming up here. I do n't want to be sitting here, he said.\\nBut Nelson denied the request, and Martin remained in court -- but Zimmerman's parents were covered by the rule regarding potential witnesses and had to sit outside, as did Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Martin's parents.\\nAt one point, Martin's father began crying as Guy detailed how officers tried to save his son's life. Zimmerman has mostly stared straight ahead without any signs of emotion.\\nFollowing Guy's statement, defense attorney Don West came forward to woo the jury. As he began, he told a knock-knock joke. But it failed to win a laugh. Knock knock. Who's there ? George Zimmerman. George Zimmerman who ? Good, you 're on the jury, he said. Later, West apologized. No more bad jokes, I promise that, he told jurors. I was convinced it was the delivery. \\nWest quickly got on with the business of making his case: that Zimmerman was forced to act in self-defense to save his own life.\\n The evidence will show this is a sad case; no monsters here.... George Zimmerman is not guilty of murder. He shot Trayvon Martin after he was viciously attacked. \\nWith the help of PowerPoint visuals, West spent hours hammering home his argument.\\nHe broke down Zimmerman's 911 call in which he first reported seeing Martin and told about following him.\\n Little did George Zimmerman know at the time in less than 10 minutes from him first seeing Travyon Martin that he, George Zimmerman, would be suckered punched in the face, have his head pounded on concrete and wind up shooting and tragically killing Trayvon Martin, West told jurors.\\nWest also deconstructed a 911 call a neighbor made, in which it is possible to hear screams and a shot in the background that West said was the sound of the fatal bullet.\\nAs the dramatic recording audio filled the courtroom, Zimmerman showed no emotion. Martin's mother left the courtroom.\\n At the moment this actually became physical was that Trayvon Martin -- I will use my words -- that Trayvon Martin decided to confront George Zimmerman, West said. That instead of going home. He had plenty of time. This is, what, 60 or 70 yards. Plenty of time. He could 've gone back and forth four or five times. \\nWest quoted a witness named John Good who described the fight. He called it a ground and poundby Martin, who he said was on top of Zimmerman, beating him. \\n He saw enough that this was serious, West said. Zimmerman cried out for help, looked at Good and said, help me. But the beating continued while Good went inside his home to call 911, West said.\\nThere was a shot. Shortly afterward, according to West, Zimmerman said Martin was beating me up, and I shot him. \\nWest also disputed the prosecution's claim that Martin was unarmed.\\n Travyon Martin armed himself with the concrete sidewalk and used it to smash George Zimmerman's head, said West. No different than if he picked up a brick or smashed his head against a wall. That is a deadly weapon. \\nWest showed jurors photos taken of Zimmerman after the fight. What you can really see in these pictures that you will have in evidence are the lumps, West said. The big knots on each side of his head.

Herrera has more than 280 stores in 104 countries and all this brings in billions of dollars.\\nHerrera says she was more interested in horses than fashion growing up in Caracas, Venezuela, where here father was Governor. But adds that she was lucky to always be surrounded by exquisitely dressed women. Today, the women in her life include her four daughters, two of whom also work for the Carolina Herrera brand.\\nHere, Herrera speaks exclusively to CNN about style, business, family and getting ahead in a man's world.\\nOn building a business...\\n-LRB- Fashion is -RRB- a very difficult business, as you know, because fashion is a business. If you do n't sell, then you are not in the business.\\nYou might be the best designer and you are so creative and new, have the most beautiful ideas, but if they all stay in your room and they do n't go out to be worn by someone, then you are not in business.\\nThe most difficult -LRB- part -RRB- of this business is to have the right teams, because I -LRB- could not have done -RRB- everything I have done alone.\\nIf I -LRB- did n't -RRB- have my teams behind me, I would n't be sitting here. Fashion is a collaboration with many people.\\nMore from Leading Women: Women-only hotel floors take off\\nOn the Herrera team...\\nI have a team, a fantastic president who takes care of the numbers of the company. If you ask me to take care of that side, I would be sitting there crying because I do n't know what to do. If I ask her to design clothes, she would n't know how to do -LRB- it -RRB-. But I always tell the young designers that you have to separate the creative side with the business side. You have to have somebody very capable to run the business side. Because then, you 're successful.\\nOn style...\\nStyle is something so different in everyone. But a style is something that you do that is totally different from the other or something that you 're wearing that is the same as the other person but it looks different on you. It's a special touch. Some people have it and some people can not.\\nOn juggling work and family life...\\nWe women manage to do many things at the same time. Men, no. Men do one thing at a time. I see my husband say why are you doing all these at the same time ? You 're going to do something wrong here. '\\nI say, No.Because women, we are able to do that. Because we have children; we have to work sometime; we run a house; we have a husband and everything works. It's a question of organizing yourself.\\nMore from Leading Women: Women ! Embrace your inner geek\\nOn the Carolina Herrera brand...\\nI think women in Carolina Herrera... I like them to be sophisticated and I like them to be classic with a modern twist.\\nYou can be dressed by Carolina Herrera New York, but you can have the accessories from CH and it's like a lifestyle.\\nOn dressing for your age and figure...\\nIt's about finding the style for the right figure or the right age. Sometimes you see women that do n't realize that age is changing your style, and they do n't change.\\nWhat you wore when you were 15 does n't look that well when you 're 30 and certainly looks terrible when you 're older. So, you have to change with the times. It's the same thing with a fuller figure or a very thin one.\\nOn the white blouse...\\nThe white shirt is one of the easiest things to wear, because you can dress it up or you can wear it with jeans or you can wear it with a ball gown. I mean with a ball skirt. It's so easy.\\nFor me it's like a security blanket. When I do n't know what to wear, I say a white blouse. You can give your own look to it.\\nMore from Leading Women: Interactive: Power in the boardroom: Women versus men\\nOn fashion egos...\\nYou have to deal with the fashion egos. You know, there is a lot. It should n't be treated that seriously because fashion is only making dresses to make women look beautiful. We 're not inventing anything new.\\nOn her inspiration...\\nThe inspiration comes from things that you have seen all your life. Sometimes you see collections that are inspired by the '20s and the '30s and the '40s and the '50s. That means fashion is a repetition of ideas. It's the way you put it together that makes it modern...\\nOn her managerial style...\\nI do n't think I like to go around shouting. I do n't believe in this. I believe that you have to treat the people who work with you like your family.\\nOn advice for women going into fashion...\\nFirst of all you have to love it. Second you have to remember that it's not going to be easy. You have a lot of problems. You have to have perseverance. You have to do it even if it does n't work and you have to keep going. You have to be strong about it. They have to have the talent to do it, because without talent, how can you do fashion ?\\n\",\"summary\":\"Explore the journey of Carolina Herrera, from her humble beginnings in Caracas to building a global fashion empire, as she shares insights on style, business, and balancing work and family life in a man's world.\",\"image_description\":\"An elegant image of Carolina Herrera in her classic white shirt, embodying grace and sophistication.\"}"}]}

This article is meant for readers at the B1 CEFR language proficiency level."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"title\":\"Lynette Squeaky Fromme: A Life Defined by Manson\",\"content\":\"The president she once pointed a gun at has been dead for nearly three years, and her longtime idol and leader, Charles Manson, remains in prison.\\nLynnette Squeaky Fromme appears in court in Los Angeles, California, in December 1969.\\nHowever, Lynette Squeaky Fromme is about to get her first taste of real freedom in more than three decades.\\nAccording to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Fromme, now 60, is set to be released on parole August 16.\\nFromme is housed at Federal Medical Center Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas.\\nFor years, she was one of Manson's few remaining followers, as many other Manson Family members have shunned him. A prison spokeswoman would not say whether Fromme continues to correspond with Manson.\\nFromme was convicted in 1975 of pointing a gun at then-President Gerald Ford in Sacramento, California. Secret Service agents prevented her from firing, but the gun was later found to have no bullet in the chamber, although it contained a clip of ammunition.\\nIn a 1987 interview with CNN affiliate WCHS, Fromme, then housed in West Virginia, recalled the president had his hands out and was waving... and he looked like cardboard to me. But at the same time, I had ejected the bullet in my apartment and I used the gun as it was. \\nShe said she knew Ford was in town and near her, and I said,I got ta go and talk to him,and then I thought, That's foolish. He's not going to stop and talk to you.People have already shown you can lay blood in front of them and they 're not, you know, they do n't think anything of it. I said, Maybe I 'll take the gun,and I thought,I have to do this. This is the time.\\nShe said it never occurred to her that she could wind up in prison. Asked whether she had any regrets, Fromme said, No. No, I do n't. I feel it was fate. However, she said she thought that her incarceration was unnecessary and that she could n't see herself repeating her offense.\\n My argument to the jury was, if she wanted to kill him, she would have shot him, John Virga, a Sacramento attorney appointed to defend Fromme, told CNN on Tuesday. She 'd been around guns. And let's be realistic: We know the Manson family, at least some of them, are killers. \\nFromme was sentenced to life in prison, but parole was an option at the time, although the federal system later abolished it, said Felicia Ponce, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons. Inmates do receive good time -- for every year and one day they serve, Ponce said, 54 days are lopped off their sentence.\\nFromme became eligible for parole in 1985, Ponce said. According to reports, she for years waived her right to a parole hearing. The Bureau of Prisons would not say whether she changed her mind and requested a hearing, but the U.S. Parole Commission's Web site says that everyone who wishes to be considered for parole, except those committed under juvenile delinquency procedures, must complete a parole application.\\nFederal inmates serving life are generally paroled after 30 years, unless the parole commission decides to block the release, according to a commission spokesman. Inmates who are paroled remain under supervision until the commission decides to terminate the sentence.\\nFromme was not granted parole until July 2008, Ponce said. She was not released then, however, because of extra time added to her sentence for a 1987 escape from the West Virginia prison, which occurred after her interview that same year. She was found two days later, only a few miles from the prison. At the time, prison officials said they were looking into rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing Manson was ill, according to news reports.\\nFMC-Carswell spokeswoman Maria Douglas would not comment on Fromme's behavior in prison in recent years.\\nFromme reportedly joined Manson's family after meeting him in California in 1967. She was not involved in the murders of seven people, including pregnant actress Sharon Tate, on August 9 and 10, 1969, that landed Manson and other followers in prison. However, she and other Manson followers maintained a vigil outside the courthouse during his trial.\\nIn the WCHS interview, Fromme said that Manson should not be incarcerated because he did n't kill anybody.... I would rather be in, because I know I laid a lot of my thinking in his mind. \\nVirga said he told the jury that Fromme assaulted Ford, but did not attempt to assassinate him. If Fromme had killed the president, no one would have listened to her, he said. She did n't want people to think she was a kook. \\nAnd she was n't, he said, recalling that Fromme was very cooperative during her trial and describing her as a bright, intelligent young woman from a middle-class family. It's just hard to imagine how she got all caught up with Manson, he said.\\nFromme wanted to be heard on issues including the environment, he said. She had certain causes that she wanted to talk about. But first and foremost in her mind was always Manson. \\nExplaining herself after the attempt, according to the book Real Life at the White House, Fromme said, Well, you know, when people treat you like a child and pay no attention to the things you say, you have to do something. \\nDuring her trial, Virga traveled to Washington to depose Ford, who testified on videotape about the incident.\\nIn the 1978 interview, Fromme called Manson a once-in-a-lifetime soul.... He's got more heart and spirit than anyone I 've ever met. She said she still corresponded with him. He's got everything he wants coming from me, 'cause he gave me everything. \\nShe said then she did n't plan to seek a parole hearing: The parole board does not hold my life in its hands. And I do n't want to be too critical, but men tend to think they do. Charlie never thought he did. He never expressed all this desire for power, this desire for acceptance. \\nFord died in 2006 at age 93. The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation did not respond to CNN requests for comment on Fromme's release.\\nVirga, who is still practicing in Sacramento, said he had not heard from Fromme since her sentencing in 1975. I wish her the best, and hope everything works out for her, and hope she stays out of trouble, he said. She needs to stay out of trouble. She's been in prison a long time... it was, in my mind, a tragedy that she wound up a disciple of Manson. \\n\",\"summary\":\"Lynette Squeaky Fromme, a former follower of Charles Manson, is set to be released on parole after over three decades in prison for pointing a gun at then-President Gerald Ford.

Full speed ahead\\nI was surprised to learn just how extensive the concerns were before the October 1 rollout. Congressional investigators claim that just weeks before the planned rollout, more than two-thirds of insurers had concerns about the system being viable by October 1. Just days before the launch, the website crashed while being tested with just a few hundred people logging in, according to the Washington Post.\\nDespite all that, the White House decided to move forward. When I pressed Sebelius on this point, she said, We moved forward because millions of people have been waiting for health care insurance, and they did n't want to delay any longer.\\nSebelius on the spot over Obamacare rollout\\nShe made that point a few times: A few weeks wo n't make that much of a difference given that open enrollment lasts until the end of March, and that millions more people could have health insurance by that time.\\n2. Obama did n't know ?\\nAccording to Sebelius, President Barack Obama was not aware of any significant problems until a couple days after the website had been launched.\\nThe Affordable Care Act is touted as a signature achievement for the Obama administration, and it surprised me that the President was not being kept up to speed -- according to Sebelius -- on the concerns around the rollout.\\nSebelius: Obamacare website rollout problems blindsided President\\n3. A-Team late to arrive\\nSebelius said in order to get the website running smoothly, she has asked that contractors bring in their best and brightest, their A-Team. I was surprised that the A-Team had n't been assembled earlier, given the magnitude of the ACA, and the challenge of setting up the website.\\nWhen I pressed the Secretary on this point, she just said that she wants new eyes and ears, and to put all hands on deck, working toward a solution as quickly as possible.\\n4. Open to delaying fines ?\\nSebelius did not back down on the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance or pay a fine.\\nI asked how it was possible that people could face a fine, if they had tried to sign up and were unsuccessful. At that point, it seems she might have left the window open to a delay, saying only: I do n't think that that really is the question right now. \\n The issue is will people be able to sign up for affordable health care in the six-month open enrollment period ? And I think the answer is absolutely yes. \\nWhether or not this issue comes up again is unclear. For now, the Secretary said the individual mandate is here to stay.\\nAdministration to kick off effort to encourage enrollment\\n5. Falling on her sword ?\\nFinally, I asked her about the calls for her resignation. Over the past few days, her friend, Sen. Pat Roberts, as well as 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan, have raised the possibility.\\nWhile not giving a decisive no, Sebelius again reinforced the mission of this task, saying it was the most important job she has ever had. She also reinforced that she served at the pleasure of the President.\\n\",\"summary\":\"CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta interviews Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about the challenges and decisions behind the troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of Dr. Sanjay Gupta interviewing Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in a studio setting, with a computer screen displaying HealthCare.gov in the background.\"}"}]}

I ca n't go grocery shopping by myself because I ca n't lift the milk up and put it in the cart. \\n My kids and my husband -- I could n't ask for a better family, Dahl said. I mean my kids step up and do a lot of the work that I ca n't do or help me do things that I ca n't do. They 're pretty good about saying yea.\\n I do n't know if life will ever be normal like it was before July of '07 and prior, but we 've made the best for it, said Dave Dahl. We 've adjusted our lives, we 've changed our lifestyles. But we 've just got to be positive. \\nDave Dahl reminds himself that things could have been worse. Our family unit here in this house is five people, he says. Within an instant it could have been two. \\nArrianna in particular has taken on a number of duties, like cleaning the bathrooms and doing the laundry, that she says has taught her how to be a grown-up. \\n Most of the time when my mom is in the hospital or getting surgeries, I have to step in and be the surrogate mother to my younger siblings, Arrianna explains. The family also includes another daughter, Brianna, age 11.\\n And my dad is working a lot of the time so he kind of does n't have much time. \\n It kind of teaches me to grow up some and how to be a grownup and what it's like. \\nShe adds it can get difficult once in awhile, but these days she simply reminds herself who she's doing it for.\\n Now I kind of understand why I have to stand in and why sometimes I have to be the adult. \\nKim Dahl deals with PTSD, as well, and still sees a therapist twice a month. And while Arrianna no longer has therapy sessions of her own, occasionally she still struggles. Kim Dahl is among 122 victims and their families who 've filed suit against URS Corp., an engineering and construction firm hired by Minnesota DOT to conduct engineering analysis on the bridge before it collapsed. A federal investigative report blamed the collapse on support plates that were too thin, and increased weight on the bridge from construction equipment. The amount of punitive damages plaintiffs are seeking against URS is hard to say, said Dahl's attorney Bill Harper, who estimated it could be as much as $100 million. URS was hired by the state to make sure the integrity of the bridge was safe for the public, Harper said Wednesday. They did not do what they promised to do -- and as a result -- that bridge collapsed. Attorneys for URS said the company's work was unrelated to the causes of the bridge collapse.... URS did not design the bridge, was never asked to verify the bridge's original design, and did not know the bridge's original design was defective. Hennepin County District Judge Deborah Hedlund is expected to rule on punitive damages by mid-October. Painful reminders\\nOn Tuesday Kim Dahl and Arrianna visited the site of the collapse -- where the new I-35 West bridge stands. The sound of a jackhammer in the distance is enough to remind Arrianna of the construction noise taking place on the bridge at the time of the accident. It brings her to tears.\\nThankfully mom is nearby.\\n She is kind of like my counselor because she listens, Arrianna said. She no longer needs a therapist, but it's these rare moments when mom comes in handy.\\nAnd occasionally, Arrianna says, their roles are reversed. She recalls hearing her mother sometimes say things about how life would be easier if none of this had ever happened.\\nArrianna's advice ?\\n You need to move on, and you need to be strong and live your life to the fullest. \\nThose are words the family is living by. Kim Dahl has had to give up what her husband Dave Dahl would call the wilder motor sports, and the five of them have taken on a new hobby: road trips.\\nKim Dahl says she 'll never be able to drive a bus again -- something she misses more than anything. She had the same bus routes for years and knew the kids and their parents well.\\nBut the family camper may be the next best thing. So far, they 've made it as far as Florida to the east and Colorado to the west.\\n My mom could never afford it... we never went anywhere, Kim Dahl recalls of her childhood. And we went on -LSB- our -RSB- first trip and it was just awesome. To learn stuff and to see stuff was just amazing. \\nAs Dave Dahl describes it, there's no stress, there's no itinerary, nothing, we just go. \\n Wherever we get is where we get, he adds. We kind of have a goal of where we like to be in the end. \\nGiven the path Kim Dahl and her loved ones have traveled since 2007, that phrase could be the family motto too.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Follow the story of 13-year-old Arrianna Merritt and her mother Kim Dahl as they recount the harrowing experience of surviving a bridge collapse and the challenges they faced in the aftermath.\",\"image_description\":\"An image showing a school bus teetering on the edge of a broken highway bridge, with children and adults inside, symbolizing the moment of crisis and survival.\"}"}]}

Do freelance work\\nFelice Premeau Devine left her lucrative, full-time job two years ago to raise her son. In the interim, she's picked up writing and editing freelance work and started a blog, where she is able to earn a little cash from advertising.\\nNowadays, almost any job can be done on a contract or freelance basis. Check out sites like Sologig, which lead job seekers to contract, consulting, freelance, temp-to-hire and part-time project opportunities in your field.\\n2. Sell your books\\nIf you 're a college student or you hung on to your college textbooks thinking you might want to read them again somewhere down the line, select retailers like Barnes & Noble allow you to sell your textbooks for some quick cash. Or, take some classics from your personal library and sell them at a local second-hand bookstore.\\n3. Search circulating coinage\\nSusan Headley, the guide to coins on About.com, is a lifetime coin collector who has been boosting her income by searching through circulating coinage for the past six years. In 2008, she made about $2,500 and so far in 2009, she has earned approximately $500 from coins she's found.\\nPeople who search circulating coinage successfully for a side income do so in very large numbers, she says. They buy rolls of coins from banks, typically in whole boxes, and sort through it to find stuff that just does n't belong, Headley says. Half dollars, for example, were no longer made from 90 percent silver after 1965, but they still had 40 percent silver in them until 1970; either of these turn a nice profit. Presidential dollar errors can be worth $50 to $5,000 each; uncirculated state quarters can sell from $10 to $50 per roll; and rare error coins can value up to $35,000.\\n4. Start a business \\nTurn your hobby, skills or expertise into a part-time business. Sites like Jobvana can help you do so by providing you with free tools to market your services and offer specialized skills to those looking for help.\\nPeter Olson says he built a profile in September 2008 offering to teach guitar lessons. He has since gained two students, earning about $240 extra dollars per month and grossing around $1,000 since he started teaching.\\n5. Enter local and online sweepstakes\\nWendy Limauge has been entering sweepstakes since 1993 and teaching others to win through her Web site, Sweeties Sweeps, since 2002. Though winning sweepstakes rarely provides actual cash, her winnings have consistently provided her and her family with 200 to 300 prizes a year, many of them large items she and her husband could n't afford on their incomes alone.\\nPrizes she has won include three TVs, two of which are flat-screens; a home theatre system; three dishwashers, each won on separate occasions; at least $1,500 in grocery gift certificates; an $18,000 voucher for the vehicle of her choice; a trip to France valued at $25,000; and, in March 2009, she won $5,000 in an instant-win game.\\n The Internet has so many options for saving money, getting something for free, winning a prize or earning money from home, Limauge says. You just need to find those resources that offer helpful information and point you in the right direction to get you started and keep you motivated. \\n6. Give your opinion -- and get paid\\nLinda Childers, a California-based freelance writer, says many of her friends participate in focus groups. Contributing an hour of your time can earn you up to $100, sometimes more. Online surveys, phone surveys and product trials can also earn you anywhere from $5 to $150. Check out Free Paid Surveys or FindFocusGroups.\\n7. Sell your junk\\nTerri Jay earns $2,000 - $3,000 per month just by selling junk. On eBay, Jay not only sells stuff she is n't using; she hits up local thrift stores on 99-cent days, garage sales and tack sales, looking for things of which she knows the value. She says her best sale was for a drink tray from the 70s: She paid 25 cents for it and it sold for $87.\\n The trick is to -LSB- sell -RSB- what you know, she advises. Therefore you can list them -LSB- at correct prices -RSB- so they will get picked up in searches -LSB- on eBay -RSB-. \\n8. Join a direct selling company\\nDirect selling is one of the easiest ways to earn some extra cash, especially if you sell products you love. Avon, for example, allows you start your own business for $10 -- your take home depends on your efforts. Some full-time representatives earn six-figure salaries, others own licensed Avon Beauty Centers and many just sell Avon part time around their family's schedules.\\nHaizel MacIntyre started her Avon business in June of 2008 to earn supplemental income to her full-time job when her husband was laid off. Since joining Avon, MacIntyre averages $1,800 a month in sales and her husband is helping her run the business. Her Avon earnings help pay the bills, provide extras for her three kids and she is hoping to earn enough to put towards her college tuition when she goes back to school to get her Masters in Social Work.\\n9. Be a secret shopper\\nKeen eyes for detail as well as a good memory are really all that it takes to succeed as a secret shopper, says Zippy Sandler, who has been mystery shopping for about 13 years. After registering with a secret shopping company, you are paid to basically go undercover and report on a company's operation from the customer point of view.\\nSandler decided to start secret shopping not only to earn money eating, traveling and shopping, but also to learn customer service skills to pass along to the employees she managed at a retail store. Depending on the clients she is shopping for, Sandler says she has earned everywhere from $100 to $2,000 per month.\\n10. Sell your photos to stock agencies\\nIt does n't matter if you 're a hobbyist, an amateur or a seasoned photographer - anyone can submit their photos to stock photo agencies like Shutterstock.com. If your images are accepted, they will be available for download by subscribers. Each time someone downloads your photos, you get 25 cents.\\nCopyright CareerBuilder.com 2009. All rights reserved.

This music even has the ability to make us like our old Aunt Emily. If there were a marketing campaign for Christmas, it would be the most successful campaign ever devised.\\nPaintings of angels protecting sheep or a masterly rendition of the manger scene certainly evoke emotion. Then there's a good Christmas story. In 1843, Charles Dickens gave us A Christmas Carol. This literary gift had the power to make us actually give a farthing or two to the needy.\\nHowever, it is music and song that has no rival in the ability to stir raw emotions. It does n't matter what your religious persuasion is. Most people can recite and hum the Christmas carols they 've heard repeatedly since childhood.\\nAmong the most familiar are the pop songs: Santa Claus is Coming To Town, which the Four Seasons, Bruce Springsteen and Bing Crosby all performed; Gene Autry's Here Comes Santa Claus ; Elvis Presley's Blue Christmas ; and Brenda Lee's RockinAround the Christmas Tree. \\nThen there's one that the marketers made sure really goes for the heart -- I 'll Be Home for Christmas -- and the line, if only in my dreams. I forgot how lonely and depressed I was until I heard that song. The home for Christmas notion originates during World War I, when U.S. soldiers expected a quick victory, thinking they 'd be back in the United States in time for the holidays. That was not the case, and the song was a huge hit decades later -- in 1943. Speaking of hits, there's White Christmas -- more than 500 different recordings were made of this song; which was originally written for the movie Holiday Inn. \\nThese songs conjure up old family photos of relatives here and long gone. We say, Oh my, look here's an old tintype of Aunt Emily -- she was so kind and generous. -LRB- Even if we never really liked her -- but then, it's Christmas. -RRB-\\nNext up are the seasonal songs that really have little or nothing to do with the holiday. Once again, those marketers have honed their skills at pulling our sentimental heartstrings. Dean Martin singing Let It Snow ! Let it Snow ! Let it Snow ! Dinah Shore and Buddy Clark doing Baby, it's Cold Outside. -LRB- This song of trying to entice a young lady to stay was written for the film Neptune's Daughter, with Esther Williams and Ricardo Montalban. -RRB-\\nJudy Garland singing Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas in the 1944 film Meet Me In St. Louis and dozens more all have great images, and are all seasonal. Did you know that Jingle Bells was originally titled One Horse Open Sleigh and was written in the late 1850s by James Pierpont, to be performed during a Thanksgiving service at his Unitarian church in Savannah, Georgia ? The congregation enjoyed it so much that it was repeated during Christmas services, and Jingle Bells took off from there.\\nOf course, Christmas is children. There are the novelty songs written for kids -- like the one about the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph. He came prancing into our lives when we were young with his shiny red nose and never left the roof. Then there are Jimmy Boyd's All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth , The Singing Dogs version of Jingle Bells and Homer and Jethro's Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer. Songs only a kid could like.\\nBut my favorite has to be Lou Monte's Dominic the Italian Christmas Donkey. And how about I Want A Hippopotamus For Christmas, by Gayla Peevey ? Somebody please explain why anybody would buy that song.\\nSo here's the question: What is this all about ? The emotional and often wonderful snapshots of our lives, past and present, all wrapped up for Christmas. Have we been duped into loving this holiday ? Absolutely not.\\nI realized a while ago that indeed we all need a little Christmas. The security of home, family and friends is essential.\\nSo this marketing campaign that started with our first footsteps is fine -- we need it. Is there a Santa Claus ? Have I been a good boy ? Or, as Nat King Cole famously asked: Do reindeer really know how to fly ? Yes, of course, to all those questions. Would n't it have been nice if those marketing guys figured out a way to make those 12 days of Christmas last for the other 353 days of the year ?\\nSo deck the halls and please stop leaving Santa those fattening chocolate chip cookies -- he's gained a lot of weight during the past 200-plus years. And I say unto ye -- Fa la la la la, la la la la.\\nHappy holidays, cousins.\\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Morrow.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Exploring the profound impact of Christmas music on our emotions, memories, and sense of humanity, highlighting its ability to evoke nostalgia and bring people together during the holiday season.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of a cozy living room decorated for Christmas with a warm fireplace, twinkling lights, and a record player playing a classic Christmas album.\"}"}]}

After all, Hampton was once named John Cheves Haskell Jr. and used to be Haskell's brother.\\nUntil 2005, Hampton lived as John -- or, as his family called him, Chevey. That year, he told his sister he had been living with gender dysphoria, which the American Psychiatric Association defines as a marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender. \\n This was my 59-year-old brother, Haskell said of the revelation in a phone interview. He had been this little boy, and all my memories had been of a male. It makes you revisit your whole past. \\nHaskell details the experience with a critical but compassionate eye in her latest book, My Brother My Sister. \\nAt the time of the announcement, Chevey was married to a woman, Eleanor, and a loving stepdad to their two children.\\nHampton, now divorced, lives as a heterosexual female after gender reassignment and facial reconstruction surgeries, hormone therapy and a wardrobe overhaul.\\nHaskell recently spoke to CNN about her own familial and emotional journey with her transgender sibling. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\\nCNN: You 've obviously come to terms with Ellen's decision. What did it take on your part ?\\nHaskell: First of all, I realized very soon that it's very overwhelming. I knew I could never say do n't do this.My brother would have never hurt anyone, so it really told me how powerful the feeling was. Watching her go through it and evolve -- not only was she radiantly happy, but she was completely upfront with it. Seeing how she handled it -- she would talk about it if people wanted to -- showed me this was meant to be.\\nCNN: Yet, you do candidly write about having unexpected anxiety about the news.\\nHaskell: I was afraid for her. I was flabbergasted that this was going on. There was shock and apprehension. I had been all for more diversity, and challenging binary roles for male and female behavior, but it did n't somehow include my brother changing sexes.\\nThe one thing is that we are born male or female, and we need those boundaries to rub up against. I think one interesting thing a feminist said to me is that I seem to embrace these binary principles in the book. I do believe there is such a thing as a male and a female; we need these dichotomies, like good and evil. We make these divides to keep our footing in the world.\\nThe sex we 're born is not immutable, and that is very hard to grasp. You ca n't really call her decision a choice. It's too painful, too perilous, it has to be an urge that we do n't even have a word for.\\nCNN: What was your takeaway from Ellen's journey ?\\nHaskell: I think a lot of people who are transsexual emphasize the strangeness of it all. For example, the director of The Matrix Larry Wachowski, who is now Lana Wachowski, has this wild red hair. My sister is so not like that. This book is an attempt to unweird the whole subject. I think it's more unnerving to people when the person does just seem so normal, but I do think we have to remember that it's not that many people.\\nSo much changes, but so much does n't change. You can take hormones to change this, have surgery to change that, but you ca n't change the voice, the hair, the love -- there is a core of self that does n't change.\\nCNN: How has it been different to have a sister rather than a brother ?\\nHaskell: It's wonderful. It's like I 've gotten two for the price of one. We have differences -- it takes so long for her to get dressed ! We 're just much closer than we 've ever been. It's hard to say the change has n't made her happier.\\nAt first I thought I 'm really losing a brother. It was like a grief; a death. But, her happiness is crucial. She's more open, more gregarious. I think my mother would 've been very, very upset but, in a funny way, Ellen is the kind of person my mother wanted Chevey to be.\\nCNN: How was it different at age 59 than it might have been earlier ?\\nHaskell: I think the reason she did n't go through with it before is because there was no acceptance. Why is so much of this happening now ? Because it can. There is a word for it and there are people doing it. This submerged desire finally had a means of being liberated.\\nCNN: Having Ellen in your life took some adjusting, even in small areas like the correct language, right ?\\nHaskell: The first time we went out in public, I was very self-conscious and nervous. We went to dinner at an upscale restaurant and the waiter asked how we liked our food. I said, Mine is good, but his is fabulous. She -LRB- Ellen -RRB- smirked and I smirked.\\nI would often call her Chevey by mistake when it was just the two of us. And on the phone, the voice is a huge thing that is not improvable. There is no good surgery. When she gets on the phone, I would see her as Chevey, my brother.\\nRecently, though, I 've stopped doing that. It's automatically Ellen.\\nCNN: Ellen initially did n't want you to write the book, but then she changed her mind. Why ?\\nHaskell: She wished she had this book when she was struggling with it. I wanted it to be her book as much as my book. I think of it as a partnership.\\n\",\"summary\":\"Molly Haskell shares her emotional journey of coming to terms with her transgender sibling, Ellen Hampton, in her latest book, My Brother My Sister, offering a critical but compassionate perspective on their familial experience.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of two siblings embracing, one presenting as a woman and the other as a man, symbolizing the transformation and acceptance in Molly Haskell's memoir.\"}"}]}

Obviously there have been great women from Britain in design, but actually there are fewer than I thought. So that was a bit of a hurdle for me.\\nFrom day one I 've never worked with leather or fur.

I 've had people say to me: You 'll never sell handbags, you do n't work with leather and leather is luxury. \\nTo me it's the complete opposite, leather is everywhere, it's so cheap a material, it's so mass produced.

Anyone can do anything they want, if they really want it.\\nI 'm not going to pretend I did n't come from a privileged starting point.

In recent years, the Clippers have made some strides in the league, having made the playoffs every year since 2011.\\n \\nSterling was recently in the news for a very different reason, though. On April 25, 2014, a controversial news and entertainment show aired a recorded conversation between Sterling and a female friend, where Sterling is heard making racial comments about some of her black friends. Sterling is not kind in his description of these friends. He said he did not want her bringing any black people to his Clippers games because he did not want her to be seen publicly with them.\\nSterling's rant gained international attention. The NBA is made up of more than 90 percent black players, so many people questioned how Sterling could feel this way about many of his own employees. His comments created an immediate backlash from the black community and from Americans as a whole. He was under pressure from the NBA to sell the team after many black people commented that they no longer would attend his games.\\nThe NBA has issued a lifetime ban against Sterling, which effectively prohibits him from entering any arena to view a basketball game for the rest of his life.

Social networking in itself is not a new development. These types of groups have been in existence for at least 150 years, and probably longer than that. In the times before the invention of the personal computer, and the advent of the World Wide Web, social networking was done in person. People who had similar likes and interests would gather together to share experiences, make new contacts, and promote themselves, or their businesses.\\n \\nOn the Internet, social networking websites made their first appearances during the late 1990s. The first major social networking website in the United States was MySpace. MySpace was a comprehensive, social networking site that allowed its users to exchange messages, share pictures, and make new friends in a way that was never thought of in the past. With MySpace, people who did not go out much could reach out to others from the comfort of their own homes.\\nIn 2004, Facebook was created. It was originally a website created for use by Harvard University students, graduates, and faculty, but it soon expanded to include just about everyone. Facebook is an elaborate social networking site that has grown incredibly fast. It is now larger than some of the largest companies in the world. It is a website that is in constant change. New features are added regularly. Facebook has revolutionized the way people stay connected with each other and the rest of the world. The way it works is simple. Users can set up a new account easily. All a new user needs is an email address to start. Once a person has created an account, he, or she can invite friends by sending a request out to people they know who also have their own Facebook pages. Once you get started, making new friends will come easily.\",\"summary\":\"Explore the history and impact of social networking, from in-person gatherings to the rise of online platforms like MySpace and Facebook, revolutionizing the way people connect and interact with one another globally.\",\"image_description\":\"An image of diverse people connecting through various social media platforms on computer screens.\"}"}]}

Watch out for fake photos\\nMany fake news stories use images that are Photoshopped or taken from an unrelated site. Sometimes, if you just look closely at an image, you can see if it has been changed. Or use a tool like Google Reverse Image search. It will show you if the same image has been used in other contexts.\\n3. Check the story is in other places\\nLook to see if the story you are reading is on other news sites that you know and trust. If you do find it on many other sites, then it probably isn't fake (although there are some exceptions), as many big news organisations try to check their sources before they publish a story. \\n4. Look for other signs\\nThere are other techniques that fake news uses. These include using ALL CAPS and lots of ads that pop up when you click on a link. Also, think about how the story makes you feel. If the news story makes you angry, it's probably designed to make you angry.\\nIf you know these things about online news, and can apply them in your everyday life, then you have the control over what to read, what to believe and most importantly what to share. If you find a news story that you know is fake, the most important advice is: don't share it!\",\"summary\":\"Learn essential tips to identify fake news, including checking the source, verifying photos, cross-referencing with trusted news sites, and recognizing common signs of misinformation.

By considering new ideas and new ways of doing things, and trying to innovate, we can improve on our products/services, increase sales, reduce costs and make our processes more effective and efficient. Innovation is key to increasing profits.\\nThere are several ways a company can be innovative with their products and services. Today we will look at four of them.\\n1. Using the latest technology to improve your product/service\\nWhen we think of innovation, we often think of new technologies. While they might be impressive, we should not use new technologies just because they are available. It is important to consider how the technology can improve our product/service and make a difference to our customer. Companies that produce cars, toiletries, household appliances, etc. often have a large R&D department to work on making their products better.\\n2. Responding to customer demands by changing what is on offer\\nBy listening to customer feedback, we can get their opinions on how we are doing and find out about what it is that they want. We also need to be aware of changes in customer demands and keep up with the times. When fast-food restaurant McDonald's realised that the market wanted healthier choices, they introduced fruit and salads, while removing the 'super-size' option from their menus.\\n3. Offering a new product/service to reach new customers\\nYour business might be doing well, but there is no growth or development and there is a risk that your competitors might take away some of your customers. Innovation sometimes means developing a new product that targets a different market. Although video games were often played by boys, in 2006, video games giant Nintendo introduced the game console Nintendo Wii, successfully targeting girls and older customers with games like Cooking Mama and Brain Training.  \\n4. Changing the way you provide a service\\nBy looking at the changes to the customer's lifestyle and needs, we sometimes realise that there might be better ways to serve them. Customers who do not have a lot of time might prefer to have their food or their shopping delivered to their homes, or they might like to do their banking online rather than in an actual bank.\\nNot all innovation will bring success to our businesses, but it can give us the opportunity to grow and learn more about what we do and what our customers might want.\",\"summary\":\"Exploring the importance of innovation in business and how it can lead to improved products/services, increased sales, reduced costs, and enhanced efficiency, with a focus on utilizing technology, responding to customer demands, reaching new markets, and adapting service delivery methods.\",\"image_description\":\"An illustration showing a lightbulb surrounded by gears and technology symbols, representing innovation in business.\"}"}]}

On both days banks, schools and the post offices were closed; on both holidays, stores offered special sales; on both holidays, people hung the American Flag, and sometimes there were even fireworks. Laura had seen on television that on both days the President of the United States made a speech and visited a cemetery laying a wreath on the grave of a soldier. Laura decided to ask the mailman Brian what the difference was. She figured he would know since he had both days off from work.\\n \\nThe next day when Brian was dropping off Laura's mail, she asked him. Brian explained that Memorial Day is usually observed on the last Monday of May. This meant that it could be on a different date every year. Memorial day is a day for remembering and honoring those in the military who died, especially if they died in a battle. Brian also told Laura that Memorial Day was also considered the unofficial start of summer. Many public beaches would open on Memorial Day. Veterans day is a day set aside to thank and honor all people who served in the United States military. Brian explained that Veterans Day is also to remember those that are still alive.

To be sure, numbers determine the time individuals will wake up in the morning, how much money employees earn per hour, what day of the year it is, and much, much more.\\nAdditionally, numbers impact everyday living on a much smaller scale. In the grocery store, for instance, numbers determine products' prices, the amount of a product available for purchase, how much money will need to be paid for products, and a whole lot else.\\nTo understand larger (and more intimidating numbers), interested persons first need to understand basic numbers, or numbers from one to ten, as they comprise each and every advanced number, or a multi-digit number that indicates a larger amount/quantity.\\nThe basic numbers are as follows:\\nOne (1)\\nExample: \\\"He purchased one watermelon from the grocery store.\\\"\\nTwo (2)\\nExample: \\\"She bought two types of bread from the store.\\\"\\nThree (3)\\nExample: \\\"He decided to get three bags of onions when he went shopping.\\\"\\nFour (4)\\nExample: \\\"In preparation for the party, Janice bought four cartons of ice cream at the store.\\\"\\nFive (5)\\nExample: \\\"Joe picked up five boxes of cereal from the breakfast aisle.\\\"\\nSix (6)\\nExample: \\\"A pound of beef costs a lot of money at my favorite grocery store.\\\"\\nSeven (7)\\nExample: \\\"Seven of the 10 aisles at my local grocery store contain pasta.\\\"\\nEight (8)\\nExample: \\\"I bought eight cookies for the price of four at the store.\\\"\\nNine (9)\\nExample: \\\"There were only nine loafs of bread left at the grocery store.\\\"\\nTen (10)\\nExample: \\\"Ten pineapples sure is a lot, don't you think?\\\"\\nAfter ten, eleven (11), twelve (12), thirteen (13), fourteen (14), fifteen (15), sixteen (16), seventeen (17), eighteen (18), nineteen (19), and twenty (20) follow. These numbers are seen less in grocery stores, as most prices are 10 dollars or less; it is however worth knowing these numbers, generally and, in terms of grocery shopping, for when the bill must be paid.\\nAfter twenty, numbers such as twenty-five (25), fifty (50), seventy-five (75), and one hundred (100) follow. So long as one knows the core number, or the number situated in the tens or hundreds position that determines the general amount, understanding these more complicated numbers won't be difficult.

It was a challenge to encourage the lower-level students to speak in English, but at least they understood a lot more at the end of the course.\\nAt first, planning lessons took a really long time and I was not happy with the results. Classes seemed to be too difficult for some students and too easy for others, who finished quickly and got bored. I found it was better to teach without a course book, adapting materials I found online to suit their needs. I learned to take extra activities for students who finished early and that was much better.\\nI still need to continue improving my lesson planning. I would like more ideas for teaching mixed-ability groups and I want to plan the whole course better next time. That way students have a focus for each lesson and a sense of progress and of what they've covered. I'm also going to put more confident students with beginners when they work in pairs so conversation activities give everyone more chance to speak and students can help each other.\\nOverall, it was a really positive experience and I learned a lot.

It's easy to imagine robot cleaners and factory workers, but some jobs need human connection and creativity. But are we underestimating what robots can do? In some cases, they already perform better than doctors at diagnosing illness. Also, some patients might feel more comfortable sharing personal information with a machine than a person. Could there be a place for robots in education after all?\\nBritish education expert Anthony Seldon thinks so. And he even has a date for the robot takeover of the classroom: 2027. He predicts robots will do the main job of transferring information and teachers will be like assistants. Intelligent robots will read students' faces, movements and maybe even brain signals. Then they will adapt the information to each student. It's not a popular opinion and it's unlikely robots will ever have empathy and the ability to really connect with humans like another human can.\\nOne thing is certain, though. A robot teacher is better than no teacher at all. In some parts of the world, there aren't enough teachers and 9–16 per cent of children under the age of 14 don't go to school. That problem could be partly solved by robots because they can teach anywhere and won't get stressed, or tired, or move somewhere for an easier, higher-paid job.\\nThose negative aspects of teaching are something everyone agrees on. Teachers all over the world are leaving because it is a difficult job and they feel overworked. Perhaps the question is not 'Will robots replace teachers?' but 'How can robots help teachers?' Office workers can use software to do things like organise and answer emails, arrange meetings and update calendars. Teachers waste a lot of time doing non-teaching work, including more than 11 hours a week marking homework. If robots could cut the time teachers spend marking homework and writing reports, teachers would have more time and energy for the parts of the job humans do best.\",\"summary\":\"Exploring the potential impact of robots in the classroom, from assisting teachers to personalized learning, and addressing the challenges of education in underserved areas.\",\"image_description\":\"An image showing a humanoid robot interacting with students in a classroom setting, displaying information on a digital screen.\"}"}]}

While a person with a Ph.D., who owns their own company, would be considered high class or wealthy. In a way this makes sense because high-paying jobs usually require a high-level education. But for some people, class is something you are born with. For example, the children of billionaire Donald Trump were born rich and upper class without having done anything to earn that status.\\nGender plays a role too in how someone can move up the economic ladder.

They have the power to persuade people to buy things, and influencers are now seen by many companies as a direct way to customers’ hearts. Brands are now asking powerful influencers to market their products. With some influencers charging up to $25,000 for one social media post, it is no surprise that more and more people are keen to become influencers too. If you are one of them, then here are five tips on how to do it.\\n1. Choose your niche\\nWhat is the area that you know most about? What do you feel most excited talking about? Find the specific area that you’re most interested in and develop it.\\n2. Choose your medium and write an interesting bio\\nMost influencers these days are bloggers and micro-bloggers. Decide which medium – such as your own online blog, Instagram or Snapchat – is the best way to connect with your followers and chat about your niche area. When you have done that, write an attention-grabbing bio that describes you and your speciality area in an interesting and unique way. Make sure that people who read your bio will want to follow you.\\n3. Post regularly and consistently\\nMany influencers post daily on their social media accounts. The more you post, the more likely people will follow you. Also, ensure that your posts are consistent and possibly follow a theme.\\n4. Tell an interesting story\\nWhether it is a photo or a comment that you are posting, use it to tell a story that will catch the attention of your followers and help them connect with you.\\n5. Make sure people can easily find your content\\nPublicise your posts on a variety of social media, use hashtags and catchy titles and make sure that they can be easily found. There is no point writing the most exciting blogposts or posting the most attractive photographs if no one is going to see them.\\nMost importantly, if you want to become a social media influencer, you need to have patience.

Another version of history claims the name has its roots in show business with performers calling New York the \\\"Big Apple\\\" since it was the best place to get noticed. There is one legend that says the city got its name because of the large number of unemployed selling apples on the streets of New York City during the Great Depression.\\n \\nThe term more likely has its roots in horse racing from the 1920's. Prizes were called \\\"apples\\\" and a newspaper reporter when writing about races often would call the big prize the big apple. In fact, the \\\"big apple\\\" soon was used to mean any big city. In the late 1920s through the 1940s, \\\"The Big Apple\\\" was not just a nickname for New York, it was also the name of a song, a dance, and a place to dance and sing. New York City was the heart of the jazz music scene in the 1930's and 1940s. In Harlem, uptown Manhattan, there was a club called \\\"The Big Apple\\\". There was also a 1938 short film of the same name featuring black jazz musicians and dancers.\\nIn the 1970s, the city tourism agency began using the term the \\\"Big Apple\\\" on purpose. There is even a street corner in Manhattan called \\\"Big Apple Corner\\\".

Typically pretty and female, like Tinkerbell in Peter Pan, they usually use their magic to do small things and are mostly friendly to humans.\\n(2) We owe many of our modern ideas about fairies to Shakespeare and stories from the 18th and 19th centuries. Although we can see the origins of fairies as far back as the Ancient Greeks, we can see similar creatures in many cultures. The earliest fairy-like creatures can be found in the Greek idea that trees and rivers had spirits called dryads and nymphs. Some people think these creatures were originally the gods of earlier, pagan religions that worshipped nature. They were replaced by the Greek and Roman gods, and then later by the Christian God, and became smaller, less powerful figures as they lost importance.\\n(3) Another explanation suggests the origin of fairies is a memory of real people, not spirits. So, for example, when tribes with metal weapons invaded land where people only used stone weapons, some of the people escaped and hid in forests and caves. Further support for this idea is that fairies were thought to be afraid of iron and could not touch it. Living outside of society, the hiding people probably stole food and attacked villages. This might explain why fairies were often described as playing tricks on humans. Hundreds of years ago, people actually believed that fairies stole new babies and replaced them with a 'changeling' – a fairy baby – or that they took new mothers and made them feed fairy babies with their milk.\\n(4) While most people no longer believe in fairies, only a hundred years ago some people were very willing to think they might exist. In 1917, 16-year-old Elsie Wright took two photos of her cousin, nine-year-old Frances Griffiths, sitting with fairies. Some photography experts thought they were fake, while others weren't sure. But Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes detective stories, believed they were real. He published the original pictures, and three more the girls took for him, in a magazine called The Strand, in 1920. The girls only admitted the photos were fake years later in 1983, created using pictures of dancers that Elsie copied from a book.\",\"summary\":\"Explore the origins and evolution of fairies from ancient Greek beliefs in nature spirits to the modern-day interpretations influenced by Shakespeare and 19th-century stories.\",\"image_description\":\"An illustration depicting ancient Greek dryads and nymphs alongside a modern fairy like Tinkerbell.

At UCLA, Chris earned his bachelor's degree in English, but he still needed his Master's degree to teach at college. Chris met George while taking a class at his old community college. George was a news reporter, who told Chris how much he enjoyed his job. Chris became very interested in his story.\\n \\nIt turned out George was also an English major, but he turned to journalism because he wanted to be published. George said to Chris one day, \\\"Chris, I've known lots of English majors who want to be published, but never got that chance. In journalism, you can get published, and get published often.\\\" Chris thought about his words and asked him how he became a journalist. George laughed and said, \\\"Start with Journalism 101.\\\"\\nChris took his advice, and soon he fell in love with writing in journalism style. Its short, precise method of writing appealed to Chris. Journalists deal only in facts. It is not like English writing. You don't paint pictures in journalism; you report facts. There is a measure of creativity involved with writing in a journalistic style, but it is unlike English.\\nSoon, Chris earned his certificate, and went on to earn his Master's degree in journalism. He now works for a large, daily newspaper. He is very grateful to his old friend George, who introduced him to journalism. He has now been published more than 200 times.

The Titanic was equipped with technological safety features like remote control watertight doors, and watertight compartments, but it did not carry enough lifeboats for all passengers. Because of the immense size of the ship, it was thought to be unsinkable, a fact that contributed to the small number of lifeboats carried on the ship. Additionally, many of the lifeboats were not filled to capacity when they were launched, causing more loss of life.\\nMost of those killed that night were men. The protocol followed by the ship's officers required \\\"women and children first,\\\" when loading lifeboats. The accident was met by international shock and grief. Many of today's maritime rules were put into place because of this disaster. Only 705 passengers floating on lifeboats were saved that night. The ship broke into two parts before it went under.
