  "passage": "Vega, New York\nReviewed yesterday\nGreat mains, pity about the chips\nCame for lunch with my sister. We loved our Thai-style mains which were amazing with lots of flavour, very impressive for a vegetarian restaurant.\nBut the service was below average and the chips were too terrible to finish.\nWhen we arrived at 1.40, we had to wait 20 minutes while they got our table ready. OK, so we didn't have a reservation, but the restaurant was only half full. There was no reason to make us wait at all.\nWe ordered the chips as a side dish and they looked delicious. But, when we tasted them, they were overcooked and swimming in oil so we left most of them. We expected a lot more for $10!\nWhen the waiter asked if everything was ok, we said we really didn't like the chips and he said 'That's funny, I love them' and that was it. He didn't offer us anything else or take them off our bill. Also, when we didn't leave a tip, he looked annoyed.\nI was really excited about visiting Vega, and the mains were just fantastic, but the rest of the experience was really disappointing."
