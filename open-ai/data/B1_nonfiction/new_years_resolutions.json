  "passage": "My New Year's resolutions\nby Darren\nI like to start every year with my New Year's resolutions. Then I read them next 1 January and see how well I did!\nHere are my resolutions this year.\n1. Get fit!!\nI say this every year but I hope writing it in public will make it more real. I'm aiming for three runs a week – I think I can do it! I think a fitness tracking app might help me achieve it. Or I could find a running partner. If anyone who's reading this wants to be my partner, let me know!\n2. Save 10 per cent of my salary a month\nHaving no savings is starting to worry me and 10 per cent is realistic. It's not too much, but it's not too little that I won't see it add up. I'll put the money into a special bank account that will make it grow … Actually, I don't know much about that so maybe my next resolution should be to find out how to invest money!!\n3. Cook more\nI'd like to start inviting friends for dinner and cooking for them. I think once a month is a good plan. By the end of the year I want to have five dishes I can cook really well so people will say, 'Have you ever had Darren's delicious cooking?' Who wants to be my first guest?"
