  "passage": "Text A:\nI am not a very sporty person. There aren’t too many sports that I like doing. I have tried playing\ntennis in a club but I was so bad at it that nobody wanted to play with me. So I gave it up. Ball games\nare not my world. There is one activity, however, which I really enjoy, and that is cycling. Every day\nwhen I get home from work I take my bike from the garage and off I go. I usually cycle for about an\nhour except when it rains. I avoid the busy streets of my town and I especially enjoy cycling along\nforest paths. As for my diet, I am not a very healthy eater and I must admit that I eat a very big\ndinner every evening.\nText B:\nI work in an office and sit in front of the computer all day. Life for clerical workers has become\nvery unhealthy lately because of the lack of physical activity. So last month I decided to change my\nway of life. It was easier said than done. As a first step, I used my lunchtime to go for short walks. I\nfind this really enjoyable even when it rains. It’s amazing how fast you can eat lunch if you want to\nhave some extra time for something else. Then, two weeks ago I joined a gym. The first time was a\nnightmare but gradually it became easier and I hope I can manage to go at least twice a week in the\nfuture. If I can keep this schedule, I think I’ve done a lot for my health.\nText C:\nI have always enjoyed keeping active from a very young age. I participated in different sporting\nevents at school such as volleyball, basketball and athletics events. At university I won several\nrunning races as a member of the athletics club, so running has become my favourite activity.\nToday I not only go jogging regularly but I started training for the marathon. I get some help from\na professional trainer because I need a training schedule that I can follow. This takes up a lot of my\ntime so I don’t go out much. Also I have to watch my diet if I want to be successful at the marathon.\nSome people may think that this is very tiring but I enjoy every minute of it. In fact I enjoy all sorts\nof exercise but I am not a fan of swimming.\nText D:\nMy attitude to sports is strange. At least that’s what my friends say. I am only physically active\nduring the summer. In winter I prefer sitting in a warm room reading a book or watching television.\nI watch a lot of sports, like tennis or skiing, but I don’t do anything to keep fit. However, when\nwinter is over and the weather becomes warmer I wake up from my winter sleep and become really\nactive. I am mad about water sports. I am a member of a rowing club and also a sailing club and I\nplay water polo in a team. I have a small sailing boat and I spend my holidays sailing on the sea.\nI know people find it funny that someone who loves water so much doesn’t do any swimming in\nwinter, but the swimming pool is not for me. I prefer natural water. "
