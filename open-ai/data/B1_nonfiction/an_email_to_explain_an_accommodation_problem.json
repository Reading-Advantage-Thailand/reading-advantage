  "passage": "From: Eloisa Marr\nTo: Sam Matthews [landlord]\nSubject: 32 Acacia Avenue electricity problem\nDear Sam,\nI'm writing on behalf of myself and my flatmates about Number 32 Acacia Avenue as we've been having problems with the electricity.\nWe noticed that if we use more than one appliance at night when the lights are on, the power cuts out. This means that we can't use the dishwasher at the same time as the oven, for example. For a while we have been careful but recently we have found that even in the daytime, more than one machine running can cause a power cut. Occasionally, the power cuts out for no obvious reason.\nWe know the electrician who came before couldn't find anything wrong, but please can someone come again as the problem is getting worse? If it would be easier, we can arrange an electrician ourselves and send you the bill.\nKind regards,\nEloisa"
