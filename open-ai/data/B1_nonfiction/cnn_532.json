He also made a 35-yarder in the first period.\nFSU also got a fourth-quarter TD from Chad Abram on a 11-yard reception with 10:55 remaining.\nFinal BCS game: Thanks for the memories\nAuburn kicker Cody Parkey's 22-yard field goal with 4:42 left made the score 24-20.\nAuburn quarterback Nick Marshall threw for two touchdowns and ran for one.
