We have seen some of your creative work in the sales department and we think you have a very good eye for detail.\nDo you have some time before close of business this Friday to sit down with us and talk through some of our designs? We would truly appreciate your advice on this. It shouldn't take longer than two hours of your time and we would be happy to clear it with Patricia, your department head, if necessary.\nBest regards,\nSarah Ford\nHead of Department\nProduct Design"
