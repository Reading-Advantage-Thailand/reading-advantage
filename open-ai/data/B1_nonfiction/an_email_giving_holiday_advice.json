What shouldn't we miss? We'll have our two kids aged 6 and 8 with us so ideally we want to do things we can enjoy as a family.\nWe've already got a hotel booked in Marina Bay and we arrive on 12 May for a week.\nI hope you're around so we can meet up!\nSee you soon,\nJanet\nFrom: Sunny Chen\nTo: Janet Hill\nSubject: Re: Hi!\nHi Janet!\nLovely to hear from you and how exciting that you're coming!\nYou've picked a great area to stay in as it's right next to a must-see attraction, Gardens by the Bay. They light them up at night and the kids will love it. Another place to take the little ones is the zoo, and the Night Safari is really worth doing. The animals are much more active at night than during the day, so it's pretty special.\nAs for food, there's quite a variety here. I'd recommend trying laksa and kaya toast â€“ they're both really typical Singaporean foods. You can also eat well and cheaply at street markets. You should definitely check them out.\nCan't wait to see you all!\nSunny\nP.S. My number here is +65 1234 1234."
