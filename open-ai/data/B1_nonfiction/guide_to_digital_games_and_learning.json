This is the big question at the heart of the growing ‘games and learning’\nmovement that’s gaining momentum in education. The Guide to Digital Games and Learning explains key ideas in\ngame-based learning, pedagogy, implementation, and assessment. This guide makes sense of the available research,\nand provides suggestions for practical use.\nThe Guide to Digital Games and Learning started as a series of blog posts\nwritten by Jordan Shapiro with support from the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at\nSesame Workshop and the Games and Learning Publishing Council. We’ve\nbrought together what we felt would be the most relevant highlights of Jordan’s\nposts. We wanted to create a dynamic, in-depth guide that answers many of the\nmost pressing questions that educators, parents, and life-long learners have\nraised – questions around using digital games for learning. While we had\neducators in mind when developing this guide, any lifelong learner can use it to\ndevelop a sense of how to navigate the games space in an informed and\nmeaningful way.\nWe urge you to read it. Start with the introduction that provides an overview of games in the classroom. Then go straight to\nthe second section which presents the way in which the research around digital games is evolving and talks about how\npediatricians, academics, educators, and researchers are working to find answers to how games and technology affect\nlearners of all ages. The third section, on ‘How to Start Using Digital Games for Learning’, provides examples of how some\neducators are using digital games in the classroom and how they find support when running into difficulties. The next\nsection, ‘How to Choose a Digital Learning Game’, gives you a starting point for game selection by providing an\nunderstanding of the types of games available in the marketplace and how to go about selecting them. Ideas about how to\novercome obstacles for using digital games in the classroom are presented in the next section and, finally, the last section\ntakes an in-depth look at how some teachers are using games in the classroom and their real-life struggles and victories."
