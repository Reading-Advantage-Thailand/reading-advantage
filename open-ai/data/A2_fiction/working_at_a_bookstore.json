  "passage": "Joel had been working at a bookstore for four months. Although four months might seem like a long time, Joel felt like it had been only one month since he was hired. Working at a bookstore was a dream job for Joel. He couldn't believe he got hired on the day of his interview. Joel felt grateful to be working at where he was. He loved to brag all about his job to his friends and family.\n \nJoel loved reading books on his spare time. His favorite author was Mark Twain. Joel's most beloved book of his was \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\". Working at a bookstore not only gave Joel access to books, but allowed him to interact with other fellow book worms. Joel often would recommend books to customers, and customers would do the same for Joel. Every now and then, he would come across a classic book and take it for himself to read. Joel's manager allowed him one book for free once a week. It was difficult to decide which book to take sometimes.\nJoel was getting paid three hundred dollars every two weeks. Sometimes he would surpass this amount when he worked overtime. After a couple of months, Joel had saved up enough money to finally purchase his first car. Buying a car was the main reason Joel wanted to start working. He began shopping online for used vehicles.\nJoel already knew what kind of car he wanted. He had first seen a picture of it in a magazine, and since then, had dreamed of owning one of his very own. His dream car was 1984 BMW. Joel wanted a black one with two doors. He would search on the Internet until he finally found it. Joel could not believe when he discovered a seller with the car."
