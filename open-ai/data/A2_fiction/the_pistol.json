Tony put his finger on the silver trigger. He put the pistol in his pocket. He took it out of his pocket. He walked outside. He saw a bird on a wire. He aimed the pistol at the bird. He pulled the trigger. He said, \"If the gun was loaded, I would have killed the bird.\" Don said, \"I'm glad it wasn't loaded. You shouldn't kill birds.\" Tony thanked Don for the pistol. \"I like this pistol. Thank you,\" Tony said. He took the pistol home with him."
