  "passage": "Mary and Tom became fast friends after their nightly meet-up. Every night at seven o'clock, Tom would pick up Mary at her house and the two would walk Buddy around the neighborhood for about an hour. Mary no longer walked Buddy alone at night, and Tom no longer followed Mary.\n \nOne night, as they were walking Buddy, Mary and Tom decided to grab a bite to eat because they were hungry. \"Where do you want to eat?\" Tom asked Marry. \"Let's go to Pizza Mountain,\" she replied. \"I don't feel like eating pizza right now,\" Tom said. \"Do you have any suggestions?\" Mary asked. \"How about going back to my house? I'll cook our own food!\" Tom said. Mary thought this was a great idea. The two headed back to the street where they lived and thought about what to cook on the way.\nWhen they arrived, they had decided on making hamburgers. Mary wrote down a list of ingredients they were going to need to make the hamburgers. Tom went to the refrigerator and took out all the ingredients that he had. \"Where are the buns?\" Mary asked when she saw they were missing. \"I'll run to the market and get some hamburger buns,\" Tom said. By the time Tom came back from the market, Mary had prepared the food. All they needed to do now was to put the food between the buns.\nMary and Tom were about to take their first bites into their burgers when Buddy came in through the door wagging his tail and salivating. \"I think he wants a burger,\" Tom said. Mary rose from her seat and made a burger for Buddy. Buddy ate the burger in one bite as soon as Mary handed it to him."
