  "passage": "Francesca picked up her seven-year-old son from school one afternoon. Isaac proudly showed his mother what he had made at school that day. It was a card made out of brightly colored construction paper. \"It's for Father's Day,\" Isaac explained. The card was cut into the shape of a man's dress shirt with a drawing of a man's dress tie. Inside the card, Isaac had written the words \"Happy Father's Day.\"\n \nFrancesca wasn't familiar with Father's Day as it wasn't something celebrated in her home country. So she asked her neighbor Genny about it. Genny told her that Father's Day, like Mother's Day, is a made up holiday in the United States. It is always celebrated on the second Sunday in June. People give fathers cards, presents, go out to eat at a restaurant, or do something special that day. \"It's a day to show gratitude to your father,\" Genny explained.\nFrancesca understood, but she also felt a little bad. While the Father's Day card Isaac made was nice, Isaac's father never wore a dress shirt or a tie. Isaac's father, Tim, wore a uniform to work. On his days off, he liked to dress casually and comfortably. The most dressed up he got was by wearing a polo shirt.\nFrancesca had an idea. She went shopping the day before Father's Day to get her husband a surprise. On Father's Day morning, she and Isaac gave Tim a box wrapped up in nice paper. \"Happy Father's Day,\" Francesca and Tim shouted.\nWhen Tim unwrapped the box, he laughed. Inside the box was the Father's Day card Isaac made in school. Also inside the box were a dress shirt and a tie. They were the same color as the card Isaac made. Tim, Francesca, and Isaac went next door to Genny's house for a barbecue. Tim wore the dress shirt and tie."
