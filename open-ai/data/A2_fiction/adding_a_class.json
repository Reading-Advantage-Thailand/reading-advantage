You're going to be constantly in class or studying.\nI know, but it's worth it.\nTell me that when I'm partying and you're not.\nHow many classes are you taking? Two?\nHaha! You're funny. I'm taking three.\nThat's so little. Don't you feel like an underachiever?\nRemind me again why we're friends."
