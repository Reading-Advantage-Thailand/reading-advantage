He organized all the bake sales, book sales and met with the school principal regularly to share concerns he heard from other parents. This is not why parents made fun of him.

She made an excellent salary, but the job meant going in early and coming home late.\n \nrather focus on his daughter and what was going on at her school. He became the main caregiver. Chris handled all of the household duties. He took his daughter to and from school. He did all the grocery shopping and cooked all the meals.

There were other names Chris heard people calling him, like \"house husband\" and \"house-spouse\".\nChris didn't mind his role at all. He felt secure as a man. He didn't believe that a woman's place was in the home. He was glad that his wife loved her job and worked hard. He worked hard, too. He just didn't get a salary like Maureen did. He was happy being paid the love and appreciation from his family.\nSometimes Chris felt lonely though. When he took his daughter to the park, there were no other dads around. He felt strange talking to the mothers. He didn't want them to think he was hitting on them or trying to pick them up."
