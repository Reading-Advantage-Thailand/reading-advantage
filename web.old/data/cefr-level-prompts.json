You will craft a fiction story set in the specified genre, particularly highlighting the designated subgenre, designed for second-language readers at the A1 level (lower basic user) of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). Key Guidelines: 1. Length: The story should be approximately 250 words. 2. Sentence Structure: Use very short sentences, with an average of around 4-6 words per sentence. The sentence structure should be basic and repetitive, using simple present tense and common, everyday language. 3. Vocabulary: Stick to a limited vocabulary, comprising basic nouns, verbs, and adjectives familiar to beginners. Avoid any complex or abstract words. Repeat key vocabulary to aid understanding and memorization. 4. Content: Focus on concrete, relatable themes and simple, linear storylines. Characters should be straightforward, and their actions or experiences should be described using simple and clear language. 5. Style and Tone: Keep the style very simple and the tone friendly and encouraging. The narrative should be engaging but not confusing or overwhelming for a beginner. 6. Engagement: Use basic story elements to keep the narrative interesting. This can include everyday events, simple actions, and familiar settings. Illustrations or images can be helpful to support the text. 7. References: Avoid any references or cultural idioms that require prior knowledge or cultural understanding beyond that of a beginner. 8. Story Structure: 1. Exposition (10-15%): This initial segment introduces the setting, characters, and basic situation. It's concise in short stories, setting up the background necessary for the reader to understand the forthcoming action. 2. Conflict (10-20%): Following the exposition, the narrative introduces the main problem or conflict. In a short story, this element emerges quickly and is clearly defined, as it propels the plot forward. 3. Rising Action (25-35%): This section builds upon the initial conflict, increasing tension and complications. It's a significant portion of the story, developing the narrative and leading up to the climax. The rising action makes up a substantial part of the story, as it's crucial for developing stakes and deepening the plot. 4. Climax (10-15%): The climax is the turning point and the moment of greatest tension in the story. Despite its critical importance, the climax is often brief, as it resolves the primary conflict and leads directly into the falling action. 5. Falling Action (10-20%): After the climax, the falling action deals with the results of the climax and leads towards the story's resolution. This section begins tying up the plot's loose ends. 6. Resolution (5-10%): Also known as the denouement, the resolution concludes the story. It is where the narrative\u2019s remaining questions are answered, and the story comes to a close. In short stories, this part is particularly brief, often leaving readers with a sense of conclusion or a final thought to ponder. (Do not signpost the story structure!) 9. Sample of text complexity: Barbara likes funny stories. She likes to hear funny stories. She likes to tell funny stories. She told her mom a funny story. When she finished, she waited for her mom to laugh. \"Mom, why aren't you laughing? That was a funny story,\" Barbara said. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" her mom said. \"Sometimes you think something is funny, but someone else thinks it isn't funny.\" So, Barbara's mom did not laugh at Barbara's story. Barbara told the same story to her younger sister. Her younger sister laughed at the story.",
