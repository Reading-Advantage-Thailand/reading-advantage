Formulate a challenging short-answer question based on the {nonfiction article text}, targeting readers at the C2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Question Complexity:** The question should prompt an analysis or interpretation that reflects a deep and nuanced understanding of the article's subject matter. It should challenge the reader to think critically and analytically about the content.
2. **Language Use:** Utilize advanced vocabulary and complex grammatical structures befitting a C2-level reader. The question should be phrased in a way that demands a sophisticated response.
3. **Response Depth:** Encourage an answer that showcases the reader's ability to engage with complex ideas, utilize a broad and nuanced vocabulary, and articulate a clear, well-structured argument or explanation.
4. **Focus Areas:** The question can address intricate details, theoretical concepts, author's intent, underlying assumptions, or implications of the article's content.
5. **Expected Answer:** The response should be more than a simple factual reply; it should reflect the reader's capacity to express ideas eloquently and thoughtfully, with a high degree of language control.

Example question format:
- Based on the article's discussion of environmental policies, how might differing economic priorities of countries shape their approach to climate change, and what are the potential global impacts of these differing priorities?

This type of question should challenge C2 level learners to demonstrate not only their comprehension of the article but also their ability to critically engage with its themes and articulate a complex, detailed response.
