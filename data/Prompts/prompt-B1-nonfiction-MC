Formulate a set of 10 multiple-choice questions based on the given {nonfiction article text}, suitable for readers at the B1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Question Style:** Develop questions that are more challenging than A2, focusing on understanding of main ideas, key details, and implied meanings in the text. Questions can also address the writer's perspective or the tone of the article.
2. **Vocabulary and Grammar:** Employ a broader vocabulary including expressions of time, quantity, opinion, and comparison. Questions can be phrased using a mix of simple and complex sentence structures, including some subordination (e.g., because, although).
3. **Content Focus:** Direct questions towards understanding themes, arguments, or specific points of view presented in the article. Include questions that require interpretation of descriptions, reasons behind actions, and understanding of opinions or suggestions.
4. **Answers:** Offer three to four choices per question, ensuring one correct answer and other plausible alternatives. The incorrect choices should be close enough to test comprehension but distinct enough to be identified by a careful reader.
5. **Engagement:** Ensure questions not only test factual recall but also comprehension of subtler aspects of the text, like attitudes or indirect information.

Example question format:
- What can be inferred about the author's opinion on global warming?
  a) The author believes it is a serious problem.
  b) The author thinks it is not important.
  c) The author feels that more research is needed.
  d) The article does not provide an opinion on global warming.

Create questions that challenge B1 level learners to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the text, going beyond mere recall of information.
