Construct a series of 10 multiple-choice questions based on the specified {nonfiction article text}, aimed at readers at the B2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Question Style:** Craft questions that probe into understanding of main ideas, details, implications, and author's attitudes. Questions can also address the structure and argumentation within the text.
2. **Vocabulary and Grammar:** Use a rich and varied vocabulary, including abstract and technical terms where relevant. Include complex sentence structures with subordinate clauses and a variety of verb tenses and moods.
3. **Content Focus:** Questions should assess understanding of complex and abstract topics, as well as the logic, development, and support of arguments. Include items that require critical thinking and interpretation of the text.
4. **Answers:** Provide four answer options, with one correct answer and three distractors that are plausible but can be discerned through careful reading and analysis.
5. **Engagement:** Ensure questions engage the reader in critical thinking and deep analysis of the text, including assessing the logic of arguments and the effectiveness of evidence used.

Example question format:
- According to the article, what is a primary concern regarding the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare?
  a) The cost of implementing AI systems
  b) Ethical issues surrounding patient privacy
  c) AI's inability to understand human emotions
  d) The potential for AI to replace human doctors

Develop questions that encourage B2 level learners to engage with the text at a deeper level, understanding not only what is directly stated but also what is implied or suggested.
