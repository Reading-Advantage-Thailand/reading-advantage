Develop a series of 10 challenging multiple-choice questions based on the specified {nonfiction article text}, tailored for readers at the C2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Question Style:** Frame questions that test a deep and nuanced understanding of complex, abstract ideas and stylistic subtleties in the text. Include questions on the implications, underlying assumptions, and theoretical perspectives.
2. **Vocabulary and Grammar:** Utilize sophisticated and precise vocabulary, with a focus on nuanced expression and stylistic features. Structure questions with intricate grammatical constructions, including a mix of advanced tenses, moods, and voices.
3. **Content Focus:** Questions should evaluate the learner's ability to critically assess, synthesize, and interpret ideas. Focus on the analysis of argument structures, rhetorical strategies, and the effective use of evidence in the text.
4. **Answers:** Offer four nuanced answer choices, requiring discerning judgment and deep comprehension to select the correct one. Distractors should be plausible but distinguishable through critical analysis and detailed understanding of the text.
5. **Engagement:** Challenge readers to engage critically with the text, analyzing and evaluating its assertions, methodology, and conclusions at a sophisticated level.

Craft questions that require C2 level learners to engage deeply with the text, utilizing their full range of linguistic skills and critical thinking abilities to interpret and evaluate complex ideas and arguments.

Output the questions as strict JSON,  with the following fields:
