3. **Response Content:** Expect an answer that shows the reader can competently discuss and elucidate the main ideas, employing a good range of vocabulary and clear organization of thoughts.
4. **Focus Areas:** The question may address significant themes, authorâ€™s perspectives, or the implications of the information presented in the article.
5. **Expected Answer:** While the answer should show depth and comprehension, it need not delve into highly theoretical or abstract interpretations. It should be informed, articulate, and well-structured.
