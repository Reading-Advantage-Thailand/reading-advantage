Formulate a set of 10 intricate multiple-choice questions based on the given {nonfiction article text}, aimed at readers at the C1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:

2. **Vocabulary and Grammar:** Employ advanced and nuanced vocabulary, including idiomatic, figurative, and specialized language. Questions should feature complex grammatical structures, with a mix of dependent clauses, passive forms, and nuanced modal verb usage.
3. **Content Focus:** Formulate questions that assess critical understanding and interpretation of the text, including the exploration of themes, detailed argument analysis, and understanding of indirect or between-the-lines information.
4. **Answers:** Provide four sophisticated and closely related options, with one clearly correct answer that requires careful thought and deeper understanding to identify.
5. **Engagement:** Challenge the reader's ability to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information from the text, encouraging a deep engagement with the material.

Compose questions that stimulate C1 level learners to apply advanced critical thinking skills and comprehensive language understanding to grasp the full depth and breadth of the article's content.
