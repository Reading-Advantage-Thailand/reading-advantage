"Develop a simple and straightforward short-answer question based on the {fiction story text}, suitable for readers at the A2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Question Simplicity:** Frame a question that focuses on the most basic elements of the story, such as what happens, where the story takes place, or who the main characters are.
2. **Language Use:** Use very simple language, with basic vocabulary and sentence structures. The question should be clear and easily comprehensible to an A2 learner.
3. **Response Content:** The answer should require the reader to recall or identify clear, concrete details or actions in the story.
4. **Focus Areas:** Direct attention to straightforward facts about the story such as the setting, main events, or descriptions of characters.
5. **Expected Answer:** Answers should be brief, factual, and require little to no inference or analysis.

Example questions:
- Where does the story happen?
- What does the main character do in the end?

These questions are meant to check an A2 learner's basic understanding of the story, focusing on direct recall of simple, concrete narrative details."
