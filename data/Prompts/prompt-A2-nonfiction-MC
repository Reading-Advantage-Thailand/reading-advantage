Develop questions that not only assess the direct recall of facts from the text but also basic comprehension, including simple cause and effect or understanding of motives, suitable for A2 level learners.

1. **Question Style:** Formulate questions that are simple yet slightly more complex than at A1. Questions can include basic inferences or conclusions based on the text, along with factual details.
2. **Vocabulary and Grammar:** Use a wider range of vocabulary compared to A1, including common everyday expressions and phrases. Sentence structures can be slightly more varied, incorporating both simple and some compound sentences.
3. **Content Focus:** Questions should cover basic information (names, places, main ideas), and simple descriptive content in the article. Include questions that ask about straightforward reasons, purposes, or basic opinions expressed in the text.
4. **Answers:** Provide three to four options for each question, with one correct answer. Ensure that the incorrect options are plausible but clearly distinguishable from the correct answer.
5. **Engagement:** Make sure the questions are engaging and encourage the reader to think back to the key points and details of the article.
