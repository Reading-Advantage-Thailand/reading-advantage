Formulate a series of 10 simple, yet slightly more detailed, multiple-choice questions based on the specified {fiction story text}, appropriate for readers at the A2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Question Style:** Questions should focus on straightforward comprehension of the story, including main events, basic character descriptions, and common settings. Incorporate questions that require simple inferences or conclusions based on the text.
2. **Vocabulary and Grammar:** Use clear, everyday language, slightly expanding the range of vocabulary and sentence structures compared to A1. Include basic past and future tenses where relevant.
3. **Content Focus:** Questions can be about main events in the story, key characteristics of main characters, and simple motivations or feelings, as long as they are clearly presented in the story.
4. **Answers:** Provide three to four answer choices, with one clear correct answer. Distractors should be simple but plausible, avoiding overly complex or abstract options.
5. **Engagement:** Encourage readers to think a little beyond the most basic plot points, but keep the focus on direct comprehension and simple deductions.

Construct questions that help A2 level learners to practice understanding of simple storylines, character motivations, and settings, while beginning to develop inferential thinking skills.

Output the questions as strict JSON,  with the following fields:
question number

correct answer
distractor 1
distractor 2
distractor 3
