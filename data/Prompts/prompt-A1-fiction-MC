Devise a set of 10 simple multiple-choice questions based on the provided {fiction story text}, intended for readers at the A1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Question Style:** Questions should be very straightforward, focusing on basic factual details and literal comprehension of the story. Avoid any abstract or inferred meanings.
2. **Vocabulary and Grammar:** Use very simple language and basic sentence structures. Ensure the vocabulary and grammar used in the questions and answers are accessible to beginners.
3. **Content Focus:** Base questions on concrete and easily identifiable elements of the story, such as main characters, basic settings (e.g., a house, a park), and key events.
4. **Answers:** Provide three to four simple answer options, making sure that the correct answer is clearly identifiable and the distractors are obviously incorrect.
5. **Engagement:** Encourage engagement with the story by asking about straightforward details that can be directly recalled from the text.

Example question format:
- Where did the story take place?
  a) In a forest
  b) In a house
  c) On a boat
  d) In a school

Create questions that help A1 level learners to focus on and recall the most basic and clear-cut details of the story.
