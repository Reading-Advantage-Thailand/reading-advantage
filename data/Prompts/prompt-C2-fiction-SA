Develop an advanced short-answer question from the {fiction story text}, suitable for readers at the C2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Question Complexity:** The question should delve into complex aspects of the story, such as themes, character motivations, narrative techniques, or stylistic elements.
2. **Language Use:** Use sophisticated and nuanced language appropriate for C2-level learners. The question can include advanced vocabulary and complex sentence structures.
3. **Response Content:** The expected answer should be reflective, analytical, or inferential, showcasing the reader's ability to engage with the story on a deep level. It might involve interpretation, critical analysis, or understanding of subtle nuances.
4. **Focus Areas:** Questions can focus on abstract themes, the author's style, the impact of cultural or historical contexts, or the exploration of characters' psychological dimensions.
5. **Expected Answer:** The answer should be comprehensive and articulated in advanced language, demonstrating a high level of understanding and engagement with the text.

Example question format:
- How does the author use symbolism to enhance the story's main theme? 
- Discuss how the protagonist's transformation throughout the story reflects broader societal changes.

These types of questions aim to assess a C2 learner's sophisticated comprehension of the narrative, their ability to analyze literary elements, and their engagement with deeper, more abstract aspects of the story.
