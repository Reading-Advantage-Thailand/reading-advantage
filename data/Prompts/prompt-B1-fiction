Craft a fiction story set in the {genre}, particularly highlighting the {subgenre}, designed for readers at the B1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Length:** Write a story of approximately {approximate number of words} words.
2. **Sentence Structure:** Aim for sentences to average about {average words per sentence} words. Sentence structures should be relatively simple and straightforward, with occasional compound sentences for variety.
3. **Vocabulary:** Use a range of vocabulary that's familiar to most learners at this level. Include common idiomatic phrases and expressions relevant to the {subgenre}. Avoid overly complex or technical vocabulary.
4. **Content:** Develop a story with a clear and linear plot. Characters should be relatable and settings should be familiar to the average reader. The story can include predictable plot twists and should have a clear resolution.
5. **Style and Tone:** Maintain a consistent and engaging style, suitable for the chosen genre and subgenre. The tone should be clear and direct, without too much subtlety or ambiguity.
6. **Engagement:** The story should be interesting and hold the reader's attention. Include elements of surprise, humor, or emotional connection to keep the narrative lively.
7. **References:** Use cultural or literary references sparingly. When used, they should be well-explained and integrated into the story, not requiring outside knowledge for understanding.

Structure your story with a distinct beginning, middle, and end. The beginning should introduce the characters and setting, the middle should develop the plot, and the end should bring a satisfying conclusion.
