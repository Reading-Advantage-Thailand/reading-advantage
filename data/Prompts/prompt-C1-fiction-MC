Construct questions that engage C1 level learners in sophisticated analysis and interpretation of the story, challenging them to explore and appreciate complex literary elements and deeper meanings.

3. **Content Focus:** Direct questions towards intricate aspects of the story, such as the author's stylistic choices, deeper symbolic meanings, and intricate plot elements. Questions should stimulate a critical and interpretative response.
4. **Answers:** Offer four well-crafted answer choices that demand discernment and insight to identify the correct one. Distractors should be closely related to the text but distinct enough to test deep comprehension and interpretation.
5. **Engagement:** Encourage a profound engagement with the story, inviting learners to analyze and reflect on the text's deeper messages and artistic qualities.
