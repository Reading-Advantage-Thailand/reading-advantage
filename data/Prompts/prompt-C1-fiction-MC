Design a set of 10 challenging multiple-choice questions based on the {fiction story text} for readers at the C1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Question Style:** Questions should require an advanced understanding of the story, probing into abstract themes, sophisticated narrative techniques, and subtle nuances in character development and plot progression.
2. **Vocabulary and Grammar:** Utilize a sophisticated range of vocabulary and complex sentence structures, reflecting a high level of language proficiency. Incorporate literary terms and nuanced expressions.
3. **Content Focus:** Direct questions towards intricate aspects of the story, such as the author's stylistic choices, deeper symbolic meanings, and intricate plot elements. Questions should stimulate a critical and interpretative response.
4. **Answers:** Offer four well-crafted answer choices that demand discernment and insight to identify the correct one. Distractors should be closely related to the text but distinct enough to test deep comprehension and interpretation.
5. **Engagement:** Encourage a profound engagement with the story, inviting learners to analyze and reflect on the text's deeper messages and artistic qualities.

Construct questions that engage C1 level learners in sophisticated analysis and interpretation of the story, challenging them to explore and appreciate complex literary elements and deeper meanings.

Output the questions as strict JSON,  with the following fields:
