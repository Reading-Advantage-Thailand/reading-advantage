4. **Content:** Create a plot that is engaging and moderately complex. Characters should be well-defined, and the setting should be vividly described. The storyline can include twists and thematic depth but should remain comprehensible and not overly intricate.
5. **Style and Tone:** The style should be clear and engaging, tailored to the genre and subgenre. The tone can be varied to suit the mood of the story but should remain consistent and not too ambiguous.
6. **Engagement:** Include elements of conflict, suspense, or emotional depth to maintain reader interest. While the story should be thought-provoking, it should not require advanced analytical skills to understand the plot or themes.
7. **References:** Lightly sprinkle cultural or literary references if they enhance the narrative, but ensure they are not central to understanding the story's core themes or plot.

Focus on a clear narrative structure with a defined beginning, development, climax, and resolution. The story should captivate the reader's interest from the start and provide a fulfilling conclusion.
