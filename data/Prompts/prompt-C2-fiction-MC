Develop a series of 10 complex and nuanced multiple-choice questions based on the {fiction story text}, intended for readers at the C2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Question Style:** Craft questions that probe deeply into the story's thematic depth, stylistic intricacies, and narrative complexities. Encourage interpretations that reflect a profound understanding of literary techniques and the subtleties of the language.
2. **Vocabulary and Grammar:** Use highly advanced vocabulary and complex grammatical structures, mirroring the sophistication expected at the C2 level. Include specialized literary terms and abstract concepts.
3. **Content Focus:** Questions should delve into the finer aspects of the story, such as the author's philosophical underpinnings, intricate character psychology, sophisticated interplay of narrative elements, and metaphorical or symbolic meanings.
4. **Answers:** Construct four intricate and closely related answer choices that challenge the reader's ability to discern and appreciate subtle nuances. The correct answer should demand a deep and comprehensive understanding of the text.
5. **Engagement:** Foster a level of engagement that requires a mature, critical, and reflective approach to reading, interpreting, and appreciating literature.

Design these questions to challenge C2 level learners' highest capacities in literary analysis, critical thinking, and appreciation of complex narrative structures and themes.

Output the questions as strict JSON,  with the following fields:
