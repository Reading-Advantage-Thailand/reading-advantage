Construct a clear and focused short-answer question from the {fiction story text}, appropriate for readers at the B2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Question Clarity:** Formulate a question that addresses clear elements of the story such as main plot points, character relationships, or basic themes.
2. **Language Use:** The question should use a variety of vocabulary and sentence structures typical of B2 proficiency, avoiding overly complex language or abstract concepts.
3. **Response Content:** Expect answers that demonstrate a solid understanding of the story's main events, character motivations, or moral messages.
4. **Focus Areas:** Target the narrative's key elements, like the resolution of the main conflict, the growth of a central character, or the story's setting and how it affects the plot.
5. **Expected Answer:** The answer should be more than a simple fact or detail from the story; it should show the reader's ability to connect ideas and provide a thoughtful, yet not overly complex, response.

Example question format:
- How do the main character's actions lead to the resolution of the story's central conflict?
- Describe how the setting of the story influences the events that occur.

These questions are tailored to gauge a B2 learner's understanding of the narrative structure and character dynamics in the fiction story, assessing their ability to link different elements of the text and express their thoughts with a good level of language control.
