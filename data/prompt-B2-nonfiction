Compose a nonfiction article focusing on the {genre}, specifically addressing the {subgenre}. The target audience should be at the B2 level of English proficiency, in line with CEFR standards.

Key Guidelines:
1. **Length:** Aim for an article with around {approximate number of words} words.
2. **Sentence Structure:** Keep the average at about {average words per sentence} words per sentence. Structure your sentences to be clear and moderately complex, using a mix of simple and compound structures. Avoid overly complex or lengthy sentences that might confuse the reader.
3. **Vocabulary:** Use a good range of general and topic-specific vocabulary. While the language should be less complex than C1/C2 levels, try to incorporate vocabulary that goes beyond the very basic, including common idiomatic phrases and expressions relevant to the {subgenre}.
4. **Content:** The article should convey clear and well-structured arguments or narratives. Focus on concrete topics with some introduction to abstract ideas, providing explanations and exemplifications to make complex points understandable.
5. **Style and Tone:** Ensure the style is engaging but not too informal. The tone should be neutral to semi-formal, suitable for an educated but not specialist audience. Avoid overly technical language.
6. **Engagement:** Engage the reader with relevant examples, anecdotes, or rhetorical questions that aid understanding and maintain interest.
7. **References:** Use references or citations to add credibility, but ensure they are explained in simple terms. Do not overburden the text with technical details.

The article should be organized with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Each section must be coherent, with logical progression and clear topic sentences guiding the reader through the text.
