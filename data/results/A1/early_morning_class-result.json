The night is still young! I have a class at 7 a.m. That's tough! My earliest class is at 9 a.m. That sounds amazing to me. How do you stay awake in that class? Before I go to class, I drink four cups of coffee and take a cold shower. Interesting routine. Does it work? Kind of. It's better than not doing it at all. Why are you taking that class? It's only offered once a year, so I have to take it now. I hope the class is interesting, at least.", "summary": "Discover the advantages of an early bedtime for productivity and learn effective techniques for staying awake in early morning classes.", "image": "An image of a person in bed, looking at their alarm clock, surrounded by books and a cup of coffee."}
