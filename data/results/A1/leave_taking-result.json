I have an extra bed. I appreciate the gesture, but I must get home. Do you want to hang out tomorrow night? I would love that. I will call you after I get out of work. What time do you get out? If my boss isn't there, I should be getting out at around 8:00 p.m. And if your boss is there? Then I will be getting out sometime around 10:00 p.m. Great. We could go grab a drink after you get out of work. That sounds lovely, good night. Good night.
