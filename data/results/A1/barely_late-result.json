Okay, I'm only one minute late. One minute late, one month late, one year late, it doesn't matter. Are you kidding me? There's a big difference between one minute and one month. Look, the point is - they're late. Screw you! I ain't payin $5. I guess you'll never borrow another book, magazine, or video here ever again. It's okay, because I don't even like this library. This library doesn't like you either! I am leaving! You are plain rude. Leave!
