I\u2019m having a wonderful time in France. My course is great and I\u2019m enjoying learning French. Paris is a very old and interesting city. There are lots of beautiful old buildings to visit. I am staying with a French family. They are very nice and I feel very welcome in their house. I usually have dinner with the family in the evening. They don\u2019t speak English so I can practice my French. The other students in my class are friendly. They are from all around the world. At the weekend we are planning to go out together to watch a film. See you soon, Mark ", "summary": "Mark writes a letter to Sarah, sharing his experiences in France, including learning French, exploring Paris, staying with a French family, and making friends with students from around the world.", "image": "A picture of Mark with his French host family, smiling and enjoying a meal together."}
