Develop a series of 10 complex and nuanced multiple-choice questions based on the {fiction story text}, intended for readers at the C2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Key Guidelines:
1. **Question Style:** Craft questions that probe deeply into the story's thematic depth, stylistic intricacies, and narrative complexities. Encourage interpretations that reflect a profound understanding of literary techniques and the subtleties of the language.
2. **Vocabulary and Grammar:** Use highly advanced vocabulary and complex grammatical structures, mirroring the sophistication expected at the C2 level. Include specialized literary terms and abstract concepts.
3. **Content Focus:** Questions should delve into the finer aspects of the story, such as the author's philosophical underpinnings, intricate character psychology, sophisticated interplay of narrative elements, and metaphorical or symbolic meanings.
4. **Answers:** Construct four intricate and closely related answer choices that challenge the reader's ability to discern and appreciate subtle nuances. The correct answer should demand a deep and comprehensive understanding of the text.
5. **Engagement:** Foster a level of engagement that requires a mature, critical, and reflective approach to reading, interpreting, and appreciating literature.

Example question format:

Design these questions to challenge C2 level learners' highest capacities in literary analysis, critical thinking, and appreciation of complex narrative structures and themes.
