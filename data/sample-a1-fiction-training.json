        "2. **Sentence Structure:** Use very short sentences, with an average of around $(wordspersentence) words per sentence. The sentence structure should be basic and repetitive, using simple present tense and common, everyday language.\n",
        "3. **Vocabulary:** Stick to a limited vocabulary, comprising basic nouns, verbs, and adjectives familiar to beginners. Avoid any complex or abstract words. Repeat key vocabulary to aid understanding and memorization.\n",
        "4. **Content:** Focus on concrete, relatable themes and simple, linear storylines. Characters should be straightforward, and their actions or experiences should be described using simple and clear language.\n",
        "5. **Style and Tone:** Keep the style very simple and the tone friendly and encouraging. The narrative should be engaging but not confusing or overwhelming for a beginner.\n",
       " 6. **Engagement:** Use basic story elements to keep the narrative interesting. This can include everyday events, simple actions, and familiar settings. Illustrations or images can be helpful to support the text.\n",
        "7. **References:** Avoid any references or cultural idioms that require prior knowledge or cultural understanding beyond that of a beginner.\n",
        "Begin with a clear, simple setting and characters, followed by a predictable sequence of events, and conclude with a straightforward ending that reinforces the main points of the story.\n",
        "After you complete the story, write a title, a one-sentence summary (without spoilers) and a description of an image to be displayed alongside the story."
